# Blog sourcecode branch

This is the source code branch of my blog using Travis CI and Hexo. 

## Building

[![Travis branch](https://img.shields.io/travis/patrick330602/patrick330602.github.io/sourcecode.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/patrick330602/patrick330602.github.io)

This branch does not support building on Windows 10 locally.

In order to build locally, install dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm install nodejieba
```

it **should** support the latest version of NodeJS.
