Also, you can use the file /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/WSLInterop to check whether the script/program is running in WSL or Linux. Using wsl.conf to get Windows mounting location and system drive location You can find reference for the wsl.conf here. To get the mount location, you can use root in option in [automount] section to get the location. By default, it will use /mnt/, and the logic can be something like this: 12345If &#x2F;etc&#x2F;wsl.conf exists and if root under [automount] is defined use the root as the mount locationElse use the &#x2F;mnt&#x2F; as the mount locationEnd After finding the mount location, you can scan through the already mounted drive to find where the Windows install location is, as %SystemRoot% is sometimes not defined properly. 123456789For already mounted drive in mount location If found Windows install location use the location EndEndIf not found: fallback to C Drive, the default locationEnd Executing Windows commands on WSL It is suggested to running them using the full path in case the Windows Path does not append properly on the Windows side. individual Tools (e.g., reg.exe) Pros: straight forward and fast Cons: Possibly problematic with UNC path(which includes WSL file access, which locates at \\\\wsl$\\DistroName)but no error will possibly going to be shown. cmd.exe Commands can be executed using cmd.exe /C “Command”. Pros: cmd.exe script support (such as echo, dir) Run under Windows environment, easier to pass environment variables Cons: UNC path is not supported and an error will be shown as the following one when executing: S 123‘\\\\just\\a\\UNC\\path’CMD.EXE was started with the above path as the current directory.UNC paths are not supported. Defaulting to Windows directory. To solve this, you can just move to a Windows folder in WSL before executing the command, for example, your C Drive (/mnt/c by default) powershell.exe Allows you to execute powershell commands and scripts Windows PowerShell is suggested not PowerShell Core for Maximum compatibility Execute commands/scripts using powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -Command &quot;&lt;Command&gt;&quot; for faster speed. Include -ExecutionPolicy ByPass if you want to execute the command. For the raster font problem, you can refer to my article here to fix the problem. Performance These three options have some speed difference. Running individual tools directly are usually the fastest; and then the cmd.exe; and powershell.exe is slowest.

It also has allows you to run WSL with different distro with different users: wsl [-d &lt;distro&gt;] [-u &lt;user&gt;] [-e] &lt;Command&gt;: -e is the interesting part here: wsl.exe executes commands with the default login shell of your WSL distribution. wsl.exe -e executes commands on your WSL distribution without any shell. .embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } .exe &lt;distro&gt;.exe allows you to interact with a specific distro. However, it has some interesting behaviors that you need to pay attention: &lt;distro&gt;.exe with no arguments launches the user’s default shell in the user’s home directory; &lt;distro&gt;.exe run launches the user’s default shell in the current working directory; &lt;distro&gt;.exe run [Command] run the provided command line in the current working directory with user’s default shell. But there are some issues: Imported distributions don’t have &lt;distro&gt;.exe .exe can be different from distribution registered name. Bonus Section I am not able to cover everything in WSLConf, so here are some additional tips and tricks you might be interested in: Start WSL GUI apps without command prompt I have posted a post about this topic before. You can view it here. WSL-related Registry: a small dive The section is moved to this post for better visibility. Execute Windows executables using Administrator in WSL You can start using the Start-Process command in powershell, which will become something like the following: 1powershell.exe -NonInteractive -NoProfile -Command &quot;Start-Process -FilePath powershell.exe -WorkingDirectory \\&quot;$(wslpath -w $(pwd))\\&quot; -ArgumentList &quot;-NonInteractive -NoProfile -Command &lt;Command&gt;&quot; -Verb RunAs&quot; You might also want to tweak the line for your needs. If you find this is a bit too long or it is a bit complicated, you can use the following script from scoop creator Luke Sampson to do the thing: https://github.com/lukesampson/psutils/blob/master/sudo.ps1. To use this one, -ExecutionPolicy ByPass is suggested to use."}],"posts":[{"title":"How to change multiple emails in Your Repos","slug":"github-multiple-email-change","date":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/06/04/github-multiple-email-change/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2021/06/04/github-multiple-email-change/","excerpt":"Recently, I am programming an app on GitHub (Yes, it is WeCode as you have guessed), but I suddenly realized the commits are not properly shown in my dashboard:","text":"Recently, I am programming an app on GitHub (Yes, it is WeCode as you have guessed), but I suddenly realized the commits are not properly shown in my dashboard: As a GitHuber, I hate that not all my commits are not shown. As I browse the Git History in Visual Studio, I find that Microsoft changed my email address: Well done, Microsoft. GitHub actually provides you with a feature to change author info . However, I found it misleading and confusing to the newbies, while only support only one email address. So I decided to write a new instruction for newbies for better understanding. Changing author info To change the name and/or email address recorded in existing commits, you must rewrite the entire history of your Git repository. This action is destructive to your repository’s history. If you’re collaborating on a repository with others, it’s considered bad practice to rewrite published history. You should only do this in an emergency. Changing the Git history of your repository using a script We’ve created a script that will change any commits that previously had the old email address in its author or committer fields to use the correct name and email address. Running this script rewrites history for all repository collaborators. After completing these steps, any person with forks or clones must fetch the rewritten history and rebase any local changes into the rewritten history. Before running this script, you’ll need: The old email address that appears in the author/committer fields that you want to change The correct name and email address that you would like such commits to be attributed to Instruction: Open Git Bash. Create a fresh, bare clone of your repository: 12git clone --bare https://github.com/*user*/*repo*.gitcd *repo*.git Copy and paste the script in a text editor, replacing the following variables based on the information you gathered: OLD_EMAIL CORRECT_NAME CORRECT_EMAIL 123456789101112131415161718192021222324#!/bin/sh# see https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/git filter-branch --env-filter 'OLD_EMAIL=( \"your-old-email@example.com\" \"another-old-email@example.com\" \"your-git-email@users.noreply.github.com\")CORRECT_NAME=\"Your Correct Name\"CORRECT_EMAIL=\"your-correct-email@example.com\"for NEW_EMAIL in $&#123;OLD_EMAIL[@]&#125;; do if [ \"$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL\" == \"$NEW_EMAIL\" ]; then export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=\"$CORRECT_NAME\" export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=\"$CORRECT_EMAIL\" fi if [ \"$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL\" == \"$NEW_EMAIL\" ]; then export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=\"$CORRECT_NAME\" export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=\"$CORRECT_EMAIL\" fidone' --tag-name-filter cat -- --branches --tags Save the script in the repository folder just created as git-author-rewrite.sh.

The Microsoft Build this year was, you know, all virtual again. As a person who is more interested in .NET and WSL development, I find it disappointing that not much of Windows development is mentioned in the entire conference. It made me miss Build 2019. While I am still not recovered from my master’s study, my laptop died right during the Build conference; I can only provide a straightforward summary of this year’s Build. Well, I think let’s dive in. WSL To my disappointment, there is not much new in this build. This build generally recapped everything we have so far, such as WSLg and ``wsl --install`. The only new thing I noticed is Visual Studio’s ability to debug using the browser in WSL using WSLg. .NET The sessions about .NET is packed with information, although there is nearly 1-digit number of sessions about it. .NET Upgrade Assistant (Help upgrade .NET project to latest version) would be possibly a great tool for me to migrate my old projects to newer version, and .NET 6 with its Single stack (only one SDK, BCL, Toolchain for cross-platform) structure made it looks really promising. Here is a quick sum up from the session: C# 10 Syntactic Simplications In-line comparison (Equals in {} in Writeline can be simplified to just ==) Record structs record class/struct Improvements to lambdas and auto-properties init for simple initialization required option for init items =&gt; for init, get and set !! for check incoming variable global using for all dependency accorss namespace &lt;name&gt;;can be used instead of the oldnamespace &lt;name&gt; {} Web API (minimal) .NET MAUI dotnet new maui Speacial Resources type (Maui*) Would be really great for some projects Blazor WebAssembly ahead-of-time compilation Error boundaries Razor component type inference &amp; generic type constraints Dynamic Components Blazor state persistence during prendering Fluent UI ASP.NET Core Runtime HTTP/3 HTTP logging middleware Shadow copying for IIS deployment OpenTelementary support API Minimal APIs start.cs is now optional lambda support provide experience similar to NodeJS Async streaming IAsyncDisposable support gRPC client retries &amp; load balancing Web UI CSS isolation for Pages &amp; Views Improved SPA support Other winget 1.0 Visual Studio Hot Reload; this will save a lot of times for me Project Reunion 0.8 Provides UWP-like interface MAUI+WinUI 1.0 will come with the notification feature","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"C#","slug":"C","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/C/"},{"name":"WSL","slug":"WSL","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/WSL/"},{"name":"Microsoft Build","slug":"Microsoft-Build","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Microsoft-Build/"},{"name":"WSLg","slug":"WSLg","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/WSLg/"}]},{"title":"Ubuntu 16.04 End-Of-Life on WSL: What you should do","slug":"wsl-ubuntu1604-eol","date":"2021-04-30T19:47:43.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.312Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/04/30/wsl-ubuntu1604-eol/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2021/04/30/wsl-ubuntu1604-eol/","excerpt":"","text":"Ubuntu 16.04 LTS reached End-Of-Life today. This also means Ubuntu 16.04 on Windows also will get off from the Microsoft Store.

If you still have a WSL instance running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, you can take the following actions. Move Ubuntu 16.04 images to another Ubuntu UWP As Ubuntu 16.04 is removed from the Microsoft Store, it is suggested to move your WSL system to another supported UWP version of Ubuntu: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Ubuntu Download one of them, open it once, and proceed to the following steps: Export and Remove Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Export your current distro to a tarball: 1wsl --export Ubuntu-16.04 ubuntu1604.tar It would be best if you also used this as a copy of your original Ubuntu 16.04 backup.

Now we should upgrade your system to a supported one: Upgrading Ubuntu 16.04 to the latest supported version You should still be able to upgrade to the latest supported version when this article is written. But if you miss the deadline, you should follow the following method to perform the release upgrade. Update sources.list To begin the upgrade, make sure you have a sources.list like the following: 1234567# Requireddeb http:&#x2F;&#x2F;old-releases.ubuntu.com&#x2F;ubuntu&#x2F; xenial main restricted universe multiversedeb http:&#x2F;&#x2F;old-releases.ubuntu.com&#x2F;ubuntu&#x2F; xenial-updates main restricted universe multiversedeb http:&#x2F;&#x2F;old-releases.ubuntu.com&#x2F;ubuntu&#x2F; xenial-security main restricted universe multiverse# Optional#deb http:&#x2F;&#x2F;old-releases.ubuntu.com&#x2F;ubuntu&#x2F; CODENAME-backports main restricted universe multiverse You can use -backports and or -proposed if you want. Dependencies It would help if you also made sure meta-package ubuntu-wsl is installed so the upgrade can continue without problems.

You can type [Console]::OutputEncoding and [Console]::InputEncoding in Powershell, and you can see what language/encoding/code page your console is currently using (Mine here is already corrupted during the debugging): However, As we mentioned in powershell raster font problem article, we need UTF-8 all the time. Thus, we can force input to follow your system language by using [Console]::InputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(&lt;codepage&gt;) command, where codepage is… well… code page; we can then force the output to use UTF-8 by using [Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 command. Both commands should be executed before executing your command, so it should be something like this: 1powershell.exe ... -Command \"[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8; [Console]::InputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(&lt;codepage&gt;); &lt;command&gt;\" Combining from the base, we got the following: 12345oemcp=$(reg.exe query \"HKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\Nls\\\\CodePage\" /v OEMCP 2&gt;&amp;1 | sed -n 3p | sed -e 's|\\r||g' | grep -o '[[:digit:]]*')chcp.com $oemcpoemcp=$(($oemcp+0))powershell.exe ... -Command \"[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8; [Console]::InputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding($cp); &lt;command&gt;\"chcp.com 65001 And now the problem is now gone!

With getting Nintendo Switch, I no longer just jogging… I also do different exercises in RingFit Adventure and Rope Skipping in Rope Jump Challenge, which made me regret why I didn’t get it early this year. Find a job or pursue a master degree successfully I actually never thought this would not only be achieved but also the “or” should be changed to “and.” Not only I got a dream job at Canonical, but even I earned a master’s degree offer from CUHK with a scholarship. 2020, what did I do? This year, despite the awful toxic environment around the world, I did more things I thought I would do this year, mostly due to lock-downs. I gave a talk in WSLConf 2020, and with the help of it, I was able to get a Software Developer job at Canonical focusing on developing Ubuntu for WSL and Hyper-V. I thought this is the end of the surprise, but no, I got a master’s offer with a scholarship! I never thought I would achieve that much this year, but here we are. This year, I started to study Esperanto(Estas mia plej flua lingvo, unu afiŝo elvenos baldaŭ), Japanese(流暢に話せません), and French(Je est débutant). This year, I got Netflix and started to watch there, which allowed me to watch more movies and shows than before. This year, I did not do much of the reading, mostly due to the work and study. I do pick up the Fazbear’s Frights series, but that is mostly all. Next year, I think I can get more chances to read after my master study complete. 2020, what did I make? I made a lot of things this year. Within this year, I made Ubuntu WSL Onboarding Experience that consists of the main OOBE Experience (ubuntu-wsl-oobe), the ubuntuwsl utility (ubuntu-wsl-integration), and CI/CD system for Ubuntu (ubuntu-cooker). Also, during this period, I successfully completed another project, PsUWI. My old project, wslu now reaches version 3.2.1, and 4.0.0 is still being worked on. Due to the pandemic, I cannot do much of the photography this year, but I did take some of the photos that receive some good response like this one with over 100k views. 2021, what’s next? Write a novel planned and Ultimate Guide to WSL I have a terrible habit of not able to concentrate on writing… This year, I will start trying my best to spare time to write them. Get a girlfriend Well, THE annual list member that won’t be crossed out any time soon ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Get Fit As I continue to exercise, I should start moving to the next stage: Not just exercise, I should begin to lose weight and get fit.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Annual Review","slug":"Annual-Review","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Annual-Review/"}]},{"title":"Implement a \"tab\" in JavaScript","slug":"js-tab-uwu","date":"2020-11-09T15:53:25.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/09/js-tab-uwu/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2020/11/09/js-tab-uwu/","excerpt":"","text":"TL;DR This article is a quick guide on building a simple tab on a webpage using vanilla JavaScript. WHY? If you saw this post, You will know that I already remove the tab on my homepage. I decided that I don’t want the tab on my site anymore; so I decided to write an article about this to archive it. Here is how it works, and it is all happening on the same page: Some people might be already shouting at me for using vanilla JavaScript; To be honest, I am not that kind of JavaScript framework guy; I like to keep thing simple (but most of the time they turn out to be spaghetti) like this site (Like, I literally inherited the CSS stylesheet from bettermotherf**kingwebsite.com; more details here). Well, less talking more writing. The real part I can just that there and call it for a day, you know. Well, I will not. I will, at least, explain some parts of it. First, we got the function openSection() that we used in onclick property: 12345678function openSection(SecName) &#123; var i, tabcontent; tabcontent = document.getElementsByClassName(\"tabcontent\"); for (i = 0; i &lt; tabcontent.length; i++) &#123; tabcontent[i].style.display = \"none\";. &#125; document.getElementById(SecName).style.display = \"block\";&#125; This function will try to find all tag with class name tabcontent and set their display to none. Then, find the tabcontent with the name passed from SecName and set only that to block. For the window.onload event, this allows you to load the default tab by id. 123window.onload = function() &#123; document.getElementById('default-tab').click()&#125; You might be curious with the CSS part, since it looks useless: 123.tabcontent &#123; display: none;&#125; However, this is very important. This small piece of spaghetti CSS prevents the situation in some browser that, for some reason, it is not fast enough to set the display to none, causing the web page to look bad when loading.

This is a updated version since WSLConf 2020. Information of WSL distributions store here: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Lxss. Overview Subkeys are the definition of single WSL distributions. They are named using GUID. DafaultDistribution, RGE_SZ: This defines the default distribution used when using bash.exe and wsl.exe. The value passed is a GUID. By default, it’s the first distribution installed. DefaultVersion, REG_DWORD: (WSL2 Only) This defines the default WSL version that would be used for new WSL distributions. Value for WSL1 is 0x1(1); for WSL2, 0x2(2). Store Distribution Key Here are the details of the key values: BasePath, REG_SZ: This defines where the WSL distribution source location is. DefaultEnvironment, REG_MULTI_SZ: This defines the default environment value that passed to WSL Distribution when opening the WSL distribution. DefaultUid, REG_DWORD: This defines the default user for the distro. The value uses the uid in Linux, for example, root is always 0. DistributionName, REG_SZ: This defines the registered name of the WSL distribution. This will be used in wsl.exe --list and in wsl.exe -d. Flags, REG_DWORD: This defines the behavior of a distribution registered with the Windows Subsystem for Linux. The value passed is numeral combination of enumeration WSL_DISTRIBUTION_FLAGS , which is used by function WslConfigureDistribution in wslapi.h. The default value is WSL_DISTRIBUTION_FLAGS_DEFAULT, which is 0x7(7) in older version and 0xf(15) in newer version. Known available single options are the following: WSL_DISTRIBUTION_FLAGS_NONE: 0x0(0) WSL_DISTRIBUTION_FLAGS_ENABLE_INTEROP: 0x1(1) WSL_DISTRIBUTION_FLAGS_APPEND_NT_PATH: 0x2(2) WSL_DISTRIBUTION_FLAGS_ENABLE_DRIVE_MOUNTING: 0x4(4) There is also one undocumented flag with value 0x8(8) in the newer version, which defines which WSL version it is using. With the flag, the distro will be using WSL2. KernelCommandLine, REG_SZ: (2004 Only) This defines the command passed to WSL2 Kernel. PackageFamilyName, REG_SZ: This defines the WSL distribution’s UWP package Family name. State, REG_DWORD: This defines the state of WSL distribution. By default, it is in normal state 0x1(1). Here are also some other states: Normal: 0x1(1) Installing: 0x3(3) Uninstalling: 0x4(4) Version, REG_DWORD: Do not confuse this with DefaultVersion! They define two entire different settings. This defines whether you are using wslfs or lxfs for the filesystem. Value for lxfs is 0x1(1); for wslfs, 0x2(2).

I have been setting up Debian repositories for wslu and some other packages. You can check out my Debian and Kali Linux repository for wslu here and here. Setup We will set up the repository using reprepro. You can install reprepro using your distro’s package manager, for example, sudo apt install reprepro for debian-based operating systems. Now, you can create Create a directory for your repository. Here, I will call it repo. Create a folder conf under the repo folder, and under conf folder, create a file called distributions with the following content: 1234567Origin: repo.example.comLabel: repo.example.comCodename: trustyArchitectures: i386 amd64 sourceComponents: mainDescription: example repoSignWith: Yes Here is a quick reference of this file: Origin: This field is used to identify where this repository is coming from. Usually, it is a URL. Label: Similar to Origin Codename: This is usually the codename for the distribution like focal, buster and kali-rolling. Architectures: The architectures. Components: The names of the components that packages can be imported into. Usually, it is main. Description: This field is optional, but useful for end-users. SignWith: This field can be either yes, default, or have the GPG key ID of a GPG key that should be used to sign the repository metadata. If “yes” or “default” are specified, reprepro will use the default GPG key available when signing repository metadata. More detailed documentation can be found here, or check man reprepro under conf/distributions section. Now, you have complete the Debian repository. Now Let’s try to import a Debian package. Sign and Import You need to get your private key and Debian package ready. I have an article talking about a simple way you can build a Debian package: Packaging .deb using a simple script: Explained Now let’s prepare our signing environment by running export GPG_TTY=$(tty), or include this line in your shell configuration file. This allows GPG-signing running in the terminal without throw out errors. Now, import your GPG key using ‌gpg --import &lt;key&gt;. You can now sign packages with dpkg-sig -k &lt;key&gt; --sign builder /path/to/package.deb or dpkg-sig --sign builder /path/to/package.deb if your signing the package with default key. Now you can import packages using reprepro -S &lt;category&gt; -b repo/ includedeb &lt;codename&gt; /path/to/package.deb. -S is always required.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Linux","slug":"Linux","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Linux/"},{"name":"Linux Packaging","slug":"Linux-Packaging","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Linux-Packaging/"},{"name":"Ubuntu","slug":"Ubuntu","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Ubuntu/"},{"name":"Debian","slug":"Debian","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Debian/"}]},{"title":"Microsoft Build 2020: My Tiny Little Summary","slug":"build-2020","date":"2020-05-31T11:30:37.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/05/31/build-2020/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2020/05/31/build-2020/","excerpt":"","text":"TL; DR Another year, another Microsoft Build; but this year, it’s all virtual due to coronavirus. Last year’s build is such a fun experience for me; I even have written a summary for that here. And this year’s build is not only unique but also free, and it is the 48-hour never-ending fun. Also, here is my setup for the build 2020: WSL As WSL2 will be available for everyone on Windows 10 version 2004, 3 new features for WSL is also announced for WSL, and got highlighted by Satya Nadella and Scott Hanselman: Added support for graphics processing unit (GPU) compute workflows; Support for Linux graphical user interface (GUI) apps with Audio Support; Support a simplified install experience by running the command wsl.exe – install. For GPU Support, Microsoft uses a special kernel driver dxgkrnl to expose /dev/dxg in user mode Linux that allows mimicking the service layer provided on Windows. This method made the following things possible to run on WSL: DxCore (libdxcore) &amp; D3D12 (libd3d12); DirectML (libdirectml) based on D3D12; OPENGL/OpenCL/Vulkan (mesa) based on D3D12; NVIDIA CUDA (libcuda) based on DxCore. There are also some discussions happening on Linux Kernel Mailing List and Direct Rendering Modules Mailing List. The feature is coming very soon in June for Insiders. A more detailed article can be found here: DirectX ❤ Linux For GUI support, according to the session, the GUI layer for WSL will be a Wayland layer implemented as a daemon called wlwsld that will (possibly) land as a startup daemon. It uses a custom-built RDP client (rdclientwsl.exe) Xwayland, FreeRDP v2.1.0 and a Wayland compositor Weston (libweston) currently from the demo: It is right now proposed to be released in December with the audio support. However, systemd support is not likely to come any soon since it is still being working on. Windows Terminal Windows Terminal is finally getting 1.0! It finally gets proper documentation, and now stable and preview release are separated: Stable and Preview. Also during the session, it showed new features like coloring tab and renaming tab, which will be coming in a few weeks; they also demoed the coming Terminal Settings, which is still super beta: Project Reunion Project Reunion is an exciting new concept, since I am previously a UWP/Windows Phone developer, and merging the win32 and UWP API is finally started to happen. Project Reunion includes WinUI 3 for unified controls, .NET MAUI for unifying all system UI (Although currently there seems to be a legal issue for the name that caused confliction with KDE MAUI and the Linux community). As a webmaster during my university time, I am also super interested on what will the new WebView (WebView2) brings for developers and the latest status of Microsoft Edge. For WebView2 and he new Chromium-based Microsoft Edge, we not only got a sneak peek of Microsoft Edge on Linux on Azure session; but WebView2 will also have a plan to be brought to Linux on the long-term roadmap. C# 9.0 In Microsoft Build 2019, they announced C# 8.0 and showed what’s next. In Build 2020, they shared about what will be coming for C# 9.0. Here are just some takeaways. You can initial a new object using the With-expressions: 1var b = a with &#123;con = \"some other content\"&#125;; In Microsoft Build 2019, they demonstrated a lot of awesome improvements in pattern matching. There are some further improvements in pattern matching, including: - Type patterns - Relational patterns (&lt;=) - Logical patterns (not) Now in C# 9.0, there is a new target-typed “new” so you can init an object using the following: 1a_random_type x = new (\"a\", \"b\"); Also, it now allows parameter null checking inline with !: 1Public a_random_type(string name!, string con!) &#123; ... &#125; There is also a feature of covariant returns such that you can ovreride a feature to return another object easily: 12public virtual a_random_type GetStuff() &#123; ... &#125;public override another_random_type GetStuff() &#123; ... &#125; There is also a more detailed article about what’s new, which a lot of them are not mentioned in the session: Welcome to C# 9.0 Other Windows Package Manager; This sure is a surprise to me. Windows is finally getting an official package manager, although it is pretty rough for now. It is also confirmed it will be deeply integrated with Microsoft Store, and you can build your repository besides the main one, which is sure exciting GitHub Actions integration with Azure DevOps coming, but it is not ready right now","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"C#","slug":"C","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/C/"},{"name":"WSL","slug":"WSL","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/WSL/"},{"name":"WSL2","slug":"WSL2","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/WSL2/"},{"name":"Microsoft Build","slug":"Microsoft-Build","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Microsoft-Build/"}]},{"title":"iSoft Desktop: What’s the deal?","slug":"idesktop-review","date":"2020-03-28T23:29:16.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/03/28/idesktop-review/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2020/03/28/idesktop-review/","excerpt":"","text":"Some times earlier, I noticed a piece of news: iSoft Desktop (普华桌面操作系统) is now the required Linux Distro for learning the standards of Linux in Mainland China according to multiple resources [1] [2]. This news arouses my interest, as most so-called “Made-in-China Operating System” are based on Linux while being close-sourced. Good examples are StartOS and Redflag OS, where both the systems are Linux-based but not open-sourced. On the contrary, Linux distributions made by private corporations in Mainland China are not only well-made but also properly following open source licenses. Deepin Linux and Ubuntu Kylin (Ubuntu Kylin is the collaboration project between Kylin Inc. and Canonical China) are two great examples. To find out, I tried to get this Linux distribution. It is tough to download this distribution. The download link for the distribution is hidden deep in the company website. As expected from a nation-backed product, I found that you need to provide the email, name, phone number, and location to download the image of the distribution, which is much information needed. What’s worse, the download speed of the ISO is slow. This slowness doesn’t depend on your local network speed; the culprit is their server bandwidth. So I made it easy for you and hosted it on my CDN. You can click here to download the image. The latest version of iSoft Desktop is 4.1, and the image size is 3.6 GB. I used the automatic detection feature from Parallels Desktop to figure out its base distribution. Unfortunately, Parallels Desktop failed to do so, which means at least this is not just a simple fork of an existing Linux distribution (I was wrong here as I found later that it’s based on Fedora). During installation, I notice a very interesting thing: It has the mention of GPLv2 in their EULA, while not providing the source code: I won’t comment on their behavior, but I believe this is a possible violation of the GPL License. One evidence is undeniable in this possibility: They didn’t disclose the source code. Apart from that, the installation is straightforward and simple. After installing, you can see the distribution is using KDE environment: This Linux distribution uses not software that can be normally found in common Linux distributions but its China alternatives; For example, WPS is used instead of LibreOffice that used in most distributions. Very interestingly, the distribution is fully translated to Simplified Chinese, unlike other nation-backed OS like Redflag OS, where a lot of English remains everywhere on the UI. The primary issue I have for the distribution that there is no package repository included in the system, while the package server is also down. It’s a unique Linux distribution overall, and you can try it on your own, but always keep in mind: As a closed-source Linux distribution, although no clear evidence of spying, you should always use with caution. https://www.cnbeta.com/articles/tech/912899.htm ↩︎ https://linux.cn/article-11596-1.html ↩︎","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Linux","slug":"Linux","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Linux/"}]},{"title":"Blursed WSL: use WSL on Mac via Parallels Desktop","slug":"wsl-on-mac","date":"2020-02-14T23:40:20.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.312Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/02/14/wsl-on-mac/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2020/02/14/wsl-on-mac/","excerpt":"","text":"Some background… I recently switched to Mac because of something requires me to use MacOS. I got a 2019 16 inch model of MacBook Pro, and I am pretty satisfied with it[1]. As I am still developing for WSL (and also UWP), I used Parallels Desktop for running Windows on Mac, because I hate Boot Camp. After setting up Windows 10 on Parallels Desktop with come tweaks, successfully set up WSL/WSL2 with Mac. Use Parallels feature wisely Two important feature in Parallels Desktop is used: Coherence Mode and Nested Virtualization. Using Coherence mode, you can use Windows applications and UWPs such as Windows Terminal just like native apps: Using Nested Virtualization is essential to use WSL2 and the brand new Windows Docker for WSL2. Some people might afraid that enabling it has little impact on my laptop. You can enable the feature here in Parallels Desktop: Auto-mounting Mac partition on WSL WSL has been providing drive mounting feature using DrvFs for some times[2]. Mounting with DrvFs is super easy; Without mounting your Windows drive, you can just: use sudo mkdir /mnt/d &amp;&amp; sudo mount -t drvfs D: /mnt/d/ to mount your D drive; use sudo mount -t drvfs '\\\\server\\share' /mnt/share to mount netowork location \\\\server\\share. You can even auto-mount using fstab. However, auto-mounting with Mac partition requires something more than documentation provided, otherwise you might have trouble accessing the files. Before mounting, the file-sharing should be enabled in Parallels Configuration: It is suggested to use just the network location as drives can be unmounted automatically by Parallels and thus unpredictable. Now, check the folder you want to mount. In my case, I tried to mount \\\\Mac\\Home\\. So I created a folder /mnt/mac and in my /etc/fstab, I input the following: 1\\\\Mac\\Home\\ &#x2F;mnt&#x2F;mac drvfs metadata,uid&#x3D;1000,gid&#x3D;1000,umask&#x3D;0022,fmask&#x3D;11,case&#x3D;off 0 0 Restart the distribution by using wsl -t, and drive will automatically be mounted: Opening website/file from WSL to Mac browser This one is pretty easy to configure. If you used my WSL Utilities, you can already open website using wslview. Then setup Web pages to Open in Mac in the Parallels Configuration: Then everything is now ready. When you launch a website using wslview, it will open in the default Mac web browser. Here is a little demo: WSL Desktop Shortcut On Mac The component wslusc in my WSL Utilities allows you to create shortcuts on Windows Desktop. Combining with Parallels Desktop’s feature, you can launch WSL GUI application right from your Mac Desktop. Here is how it looks: To achieve this, We should enable Desktop Mapping in the Parallels Desktop with the following steps: Afterward, the desktop should show the shortcut created on the Windows 10 Desktop. However, they won’t look good; But we can do some small modification to make it better like the following: Here is how to modify it: To conclude… The experience is not perfect, but this allows me to use Ubuntu without creating extra Virtual Machine on my MBP, which means a save on system memory when I need to run Windows and Ubuntu at the same time. This sure is a great experience using WSL on Mac. I am also going to present a session on WSLConf 😉 A review is coming 😉 ↩︎ Good place to start with DrvFs: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/archive/blogs/wsl/file-system-improvements-to-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux ↩︎","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"WSL","slug":"WSL","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/WSL/"},{"name":"WSL2","slug":"WSL2","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/WSL2/"},{"name":"OSX","slug":"OSX","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/OSX/"}]},{"title":"An even better motherf**king website","slug":"a-even-better-motherfing-website","date":"2020-01-04T16:07:25.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/01/04/a-even-better-motherfing-website/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2020/01/04/a-even-better-motherfing-website/","excerpt":"","text":"The one thing I hate about the modern Internet is that it fills with too many fancy CSS elements, long-running JavaScripts, cookies to “improve your browsing experiences”, random popup to “SUBSCRIBE NOW!” They just made my brain hurt. One day, I found a website called, uh, Motherf**king Website[1]. It’s an extrmly simple website with only the following CSS: OwO whewe iws the css1⠀ Yeah, it doesn’t even have a CSS[2]! But it really did just work. Then, unsurprisingly, I found a sequel to that website called Better Motherf**cking Website. The heck? But it did look better than the previous one. Well, I dig it although I know both of the sites are satire. Here is the original CSS source for the second one: 1234567891011body&#123; margin:40px auto; max-width:650px; line-height:1.6; font-size:18px; color:#444; padding:0 10px&#125;h1,h2,h3&#123; line-height:1.2&#125; However, as the author of the website stated: I love what the creator of this site’s inspiration did. What I’m saying is that it’s so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they’re also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit. How about… no? Nah, actually he(or she)'s definitely right, it will need more CSS extension. But first, I need somewhere to test it first before putting on the main site, and the Access is the perfect place. It actually doesn’t look bad! So I started to make a fork of this CSS. Here is what I have done: For the base, I just add an extra background-color property in body, just for helping the dynamic dark/light theme on my website: original.css123456789101112131415body &#123; margin: 40px auto; max-width: 650px; line-height: 1.6; font-size: 18px; background-color: #DDD; color: #333; padding: 0 10px;&#125;h1,h2,h3 &#123; line-height: 1.2&#125; To make heading more obvious, I did some content appending in CSS: header.css12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728h1:before &#123; content: \"# \";&#125;h2:before &#123; content: \"## \";&#125;h3:before &#123; content: \"### \";&#125;h4:before &#123; content: \"#### \";&#125;h5:before &#123; content: \"##### \";&#125;h6:before &#123; content: \"###### \";&#125;h1 a:hover,h1 a:active &#123; text-decoration: none;&#125; This part is the extension on link to make it less ugly compared to default: link.css123456789101112131415a:link &#123; text-decoration: underline; color: #555;&#125;a:visited &#123; text-decoration: none; color: #777;&#125;a:hover,a:active &#123; text-decoration: underline; color: #77beec;&#125; I also try to fix some distortedly-rendered element in Hexo: general.css12345678910111213141516img &#123; outline: none; border: none; max-width: 100%;&#125;table &#123; width: 100%;&#125;blockquote &#123; border-left-width: 2px; border-left-color: gray; border-left-style: solid; padding: 0 10px 0;&#125; I also made some improvements on post tag cloud on the homepage to better distinguish them: tag.css 12345678.hometag &#123; border: 1px solid #555; margin: 5px; padding: 0 5px; color: #555; border-radius: 5px; display: inline-block;&#125; By default, these code block generated is distorted and not good for viewing.

Drucker 拒絕藉口 | Never Excuse by Orison 詩説茶文化 | Tea Culture: From the Perspective of Poems by 劉景文 帝國崛起病 by 黃鐘 夢的釋義 | Die Traumdeutung by Sigmund Freud 教父 | Godfather by Mario Puzo 北韓：從遊擊革命的金日成到迷霧籠罩的金正恩 | 조선민주주의인민공화국 by 和田春樹 What Money Can’t Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets by Michael J.

Someone told me there was such problem but unfortunately I am unable to reproduce such problem for a very long time (Later turned out that using the experimental UTF-8 option at the time in Insider builds prevent this issue). Few days ago, someone opened an issue (wslutilities/wslu issue #83) so that I have to took it more seriously and I created a Virtual Machine trying to reproduce the issue. And I did. Tracing down and found out this is an existing issue for a long time(Microsoft/Terminal issue #280). As one Microsoft employee on wslu's issue said, Powershell sets and resets the system codepage, which it shouldn’t be doing. This can cause the fonts to reset to “raster fonts”. So what does this mean? Well, by default, system have a global variable called the OEM Codepage (oemcp). It is usually a 3 to 4-digit number determined by your system language, and this is intended to help apps to determine what character set it needs to use. For example, “OEM - United States” is Codepage 437. There is a lot more, checkout Wikipedia page of DOS code pages and Windows code pages. Among them, there is one special codepage: 65001, or better known as UTF-8. In latest version of Windows, you can set the OEM Codepage to UTF-8 by going to Control Panel -&gt; Clock and Region -&gt; Change date, time or number formats -&gt; Administrative -&gt; Change System Locale and choose Use Unicode UTF-8: And now problem surfaces: WSL Distro consoles do not use OEM Codepage, they use Unicode UTF-8 Codepage; but PowerShell uses OEM Codepage. So, if you don’t set system to use the Unicode UTF-8, executing mixing commands with bash and PowerShell cause powershell.exe to reset codepage forcefully which leads to resetting the console to raster font. Now it is clear what caused the problem, so the solution become simple: set to OEM Codepage before you do powershell; powershell something; set back to WSL Distro console Codepage 65001. You can use the chcp.com (change codepage) to change codepage. So for the first step, you should get OEM Codepage from registry (in WSL): 1oemcp=$(reg.exe query \"HKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\Nls\\\\CodePage\" /v OEMCP 2&gt;&amp;1 | sed -n 3p | sed -e 's|\\r||g' | grep -o '[[:digit:]]*') Then set the WSL console codepage to OEM Codepage: 1chcp.com $oemcp Then you powershell something. When complete, set back to UTF-8 Codepage: 1chcp.com 65001 Overall, it should be something like this: 1234oemcp=$(reg.exe query \"HKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\Nls\\\\CodePage\" /v OEMCP 2&gt;&amp;1 | sed -n 3p | sed -e 's|\\r||g' | grep -o '[[:digit:]]*')chcp.com $oemcppowershell.exe ...chcp.com 65001 Now, the problem is gone!

Build 2019 is a fun experience for me, where I met different people, speak here, and most importantly, learn new ideas and new changes in the Windows ecosystem. And here is a photograph of me with Scott Hanselman 😉 WSL 2 WSL 2 is one of the most import parts of Build 2019 for me. I got some teases of WSL 2 before Build 2019 and already really got excited about it, and Hayden and I got an early demo at the booth too, which literally blew my mind. So, in the following part, I will just throw facts from the build from the sessions and the question asked: Highlights: WSL 2 is fast. Really fast. Nearly all system call is working, which means: systemd/FUSE/Docker now works properly. Sound support is not on the schedule. x32 support. mount command works too, which means you can mount Linux partition in this method. Uses a modified version of Linux Kernel 2.19 and changes to WSL will also available upstream. You can switch between WSL 1 and WSL 2 using wsl --set-version &lt;distro&gt; &lt;wsl version&gt;. WSL 2 uses 9P protocol to access Windows file in WSL and access WSL file in Windows. the filesystem for each distro will be ext4 instead of WslFS. Yes, it’s using hypervisor; but no, it’s not Hyper-V. it’s a lightweight virtual machine using Windows Virtual Machine Platform that can be run along with Hyper-V, its boot time will be around 1-2 seconds. Drawbacks: Currently WSL 2 will have a different IP address currently; the fix is still on the way. The final WSL 2 might not ship in the release; even it is shipped, WSL 1 will remain as default and requires people to switch to WSL 2 manually. Schedules: GPU support is in working(High priority). GUI support is in working(High priority). Startup Support is in medium priority, not in working. Sound support is not on schedule (for now). Windows Terminal Another exciting thing on Build this year is Windows Terminal. they even made a video for it! (Also our product Pengwin also made a cameo) Highlights: It is already open sourced. The decision to open source only made several days ago, and it is being pushed during the Build 2019. Tab support! Full Unicode support! (CJK, Emoji, Powerline, Nerd) Ligature Support! A new font for Windows Terminal! Fluent background! The scrollbar can now be hidden! Ctrl + Scroll to change the font size. Ctrl + Shift + Scroll to change transparency. The new rendering engine is using DirectX/GPU powered. Each WSL distribution will have its own theme in the future. In the future, there will be extension support using wt; Some changes in Windows Terminal will come to conhost.exe too. Deliver via store; first version in the summer 2019 and first release in the winter 2019. WinUI Highlight: Windows UI Library is live at https://github.com/Microsoft/Microsoft-ui-xaml. Fluent Design can be used in Win32, WinForms, and WPF with XAML Islands. Fluent Design is expanding to Web, Android, and iOS with UI Fabric. Xamarin and React Native will gain support for it. Fabric Core is based on JS available on npm and NuGet. Fabric React is available for React Native. Suggestions: Using NavigationView control instead of custom controls in UWP would be better. (Using it in UWP DevKit would be great) Progress Web App It seems that PWA is a new trend in building apps, so I watched the session live as I am attending ML.NET Session. Here are some highlights: Web Template Studio Extensions on VSCode help create PWA apps PWA requires HTTPS, Web App Manifest, Service Worker at Minimum Can be also built online using the help from PWA Builder PWA can be now delivered in Windows Store instead of traditional WinJS and Web Host Apps. Microsoft Graph Toolkit can be used in the Progress Web Apps. C# 8.0 As a C# Developer, although I am not really active right now, I am still interested in what’s new in C#.

But when using Hyper-V, it used to be not easy when you want to get information about your VMs and interact them with SSH. But now, with hvc command, these problems can be solved really easily. Before we start… Not all feature is available to the platform. This tutorial only tested with Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, Ubuntu and Debian. Please try yourself whether your VM works. Also, use an elevated console when executing the command. The easiest why you can simplify this process is to download scoop and install sudo using scoop install sudo. Now you can simply type sudo hvc instead of opening an elevated console. VM Imformation hvc allows you to show basic information about your VMs. Using hvc list can show you a list of Virutal machines you have: You can also get specific inforamtion about your VM such as VM ID, its IP address and its current status using hvc id &lt;Name of VM&gt;, hvc ip &lt;Name of VM&gt; and hvc state &lt;Name of VM&gt;: As for the name, if your VM have a name that contains space, you shoud quote it: VM Mangement You can complete some simple management of your VM such as start or stop using hvc &lt;command&gt; &lt;name of VM&gt;: Command Description start Starts a VM. stop Shuts down a VM. kill Powers off a VM. restart Reboots a VM. reset Issues a hard reset to a VM. But keep in mind that nothing will be shown if the action is successful. VM Connection You can connect to your virtual machine using different ways via hvc, like socket or ssh. You can connect to your VM’s serial port using hvc serial &lt;VM&gt;; You can also connect to your VM via a socket connection using hvc nc [options] &lt;VM&gt; &lt;port&gt;; You can also directly open the VM Graphic Console using hvc console &lt;VM&gt;. Here I will mainly talk about its feature on SSH. hvc provides ssh and scp, which works just like normal ssh and scp but you can just input its VM name instead of its IP address. Here is a small demo: To use this command, the only thing you have to do is to setup SSH server on your VM. for Windows, you just have to install OpenSSH Server to start; for Linux, besides normal SSH server setup, don’t forget that install Hyper-V tools before using the command. For example, Debian 9 need hyperv-daemons package for hvc ssh to work. For other Linux, please check here for the supported Linux distros. Final thoughts These command really simplified my life and I no longer need to pin Hyper-V Manager in the taskbar. Just have a try, you will love it.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Linux","slug":"Linux","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Linux/"},{"name":"Hyper-V","slug":"Hyper-V","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Hyper-V/"},{"name":"Windows","slug":"Windows","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Windows/"}]},{"title":"拆除的記憶","slug":"memory-destruction","date":"2019-01-18T17:28:06.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/01/18/memory-destruction/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2019/01/18/memory-destruction/","excerpt":"","text":"這次回老家S城，忙完事情後，趁着還有些時間，在老家逛了一圈。穿過熟悉的小巷，卻發現曾經熟悉的人民醫院舊址，變成了一座與這座城完全格格不入的大商場——它的現代化設計和仔細拋光的大理石地板，在這座古城中央顯得極其奇怪和不適；圍着它繞了一圈，與人民醫院相關的東西，被拆除的一點也不剩。 我小時候因為體質差，時不時就生病。爸媽總是不得不把哭鬧着的我送到人民醫院，次數頻繁到甚至電梯阿姨都認識我了：到後來小學時，每次去人民醫院，她總是會笑着和我打招呼，説着：“阿彬，又來了？”我總是尷尬地滿臉通紅，輕輕地點頭。她接着一定會笑着扭過頭，然後熟練的按下3樓的按鈕——那是耳鼻喉科門診的樓層。醫院裏醫患關係部的K叔也總是很照顧我，他是我爸媽的朋友，每次我來看病時，總會給我帶些糖。他的辦公室在人民醫院裏的大寺廟裏，我總是覺得這座寺廟十分神奇——這麼大的，有5層樓這麼高的寺廟，是怎麼造起來的？可惜的是，這些小時候的疑惑和記憶，和和人民醫院一起，被埋葬在了這華麗的現代化商場的地下深處。 在人民醫院舊址的旁邊，便是S城人都知道的D大街。我赫然發現，曾經提着&quot;D街夜市&quot;的銅製標牌已經消失，而D大街的兩旁已經死死的焊上了鐵質護欄。趕緊問了下附近一直在這開店的老闆，才知道政府“為了市容”取消了這座城市有歷史的夜市。 我歎了口氣。 小時候，我總是會期待夜幕降臨，因為這意味着D街夜市要開始了。大約下午5點左右，你走到D大街，就可以看見小販們推着三輪車，在自己攤位的位置停下，開始支起攤子，掛起已經泛黃的鎢絲燈；整條D大街，在夜色完全黑下來之前，就已經被攤位燈光點亮了。每個攤位都會售賣不一樣的東西：小玩具、裝飾品、電器、服裝、書籍，就像一個填滿了寶藏的洞穴一樣，等待着你去探索。每次吃完飯，我總是喜歡跑到夜市，帶着爸媽或是外公外婆給的零錢，在夜市上買幾本自己喜歡的圖畫書。每天賣的書都不同；今天不買，明天的書可就不一樣了。 只是，我從來沒想到，在將來的一個明天，一本書都買不到了；這座夜市，也終將只剩下留給我的回憶。 回到外公住的宿舍樓，欣慰的發現這裏並沒有什麼大變化。這是一座建於70年代的宿舍，是屬於S城化肥廠的第一員工宿舍；化肥廠本身，已經在我讀小學的時候就完全關閉拆除了。對這座宿舍的外牆，雖然已經粉刷了很多次，但歲月然是給他留下了很多痕跡；於老員工們來説，這是最後珍貴的記憶。我外公總是和我説，這是S城的第一棟混凝土建築；當時的他，作為優秀員工，自豪的成為了這座宿舍的第一批成員。對於我來説，這是我從小長大的地方；這是充滿回憶的地方，是我一切開始的地方。 我走到了熟悉的門前，打開了門。 “外公，我回來了！” 外公坐在桌旁，抽着煙，沉默不語。 他翻了翻一旁的一疊紙，抽出了其中一張，擺在了桌上。 這張紙的標題是，“S城化肥廠員工宿舍清拆通知”。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Essay","slug":"Essay","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Essay/"}]},{"title":"向後2018，向前2019","slug":"review-2018","date":"2018-12-28T14:56:53.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/12/28/review-2018/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2018/12/28/review-2018/","excerpt":"","text":"幹了些啥？ 2018， 這是一個註定不平凡的一年。 1月，美國交換。紐約，羅拉，聖路易斯，芝加哥，西雅圖。交了新朋友，還見了闊別6年的舊友。第一次在海外過春節，第一次自己計劃旅程，許許多多的第一次，貢獻給了美國之旅。 2月，我正式放棄開發 UWP 應用，專注開發 wslu. 感謝自己做出了正確的決定，如果不放手，我的項目不會超過300星，我也不會加入 Whitewater Foundry, 我會仍然原地踏步。 6月，參加在杭州的實習。 7月，參加TechCrunch大會。 8月，9月，10月，難熬的託福和GRE。 9月，加入Whitewater Foundry。 12月，學期結束。盡了自己的最大努力，雖然成績仍不如意，但是我這次，能告訴我自己：我真的盡力了。 看了些啥？ 士兵的重負 | The Things They Carried Tim O’Brien 一本關於越南戰爭的書。這種半自傳的設定，很喜歡。 廉價車之王 | The Fivver King Upton Sinclair 一個關於美國20世紀初，福特公司的故事。 夢幻花 | むげんばな 東野圭吾 因為他，我愛上了偵探小説。但這本書，卻頗有虎頭蛇尾之感覺。 寫/畫/拍了些啥？ 似乎今年，沒寫些啥。想要寫《和平路書報攤》和《WSL指北》，但都只寫了個開頭。 哦對了，寫了美國交流的感想。 畫到是不少，就是垃圾了點。比如新的分類圖，還有還有，Jokes On Me。 代碼也是寫了不少。主要還是wslu和WLinux。還有畢業設計。還有MSSS的論壇改版。差不多就這些了。 拍了不少照片，不過大部分還是用手機。拿到 Canon 5D Mark IV 後立即拍了些。還不錯。 2019，幹啥？ 寫完《和平路書報攤》和《WSL指北》； 認真的去找個女朋友； 繼續保持鍛鍊，瘦下來。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Annual Review","slug":"Annual-Review","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Annual-Review/"}]},{"title":"fix Octave LibQt5Core issue in WSL Arch Linux","slug":"wsl-libqt5core-issue-fix-arch","date":"2018-11-05T10:43:24.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.312Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/11/05/wsl-libqt5core-issue-fix-arch/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2018/11/05/wsl-libqt5core-issue-fix-arch/","excerpt":"","text":"Recently I started to do things in the Arch Linux since some people request to bring my wslu to ArchWSL(https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL).

Windows 10 Linux Subsystem Windows 10 Linux Subsystem can use loopback without issue of course, but the proxy is not properly applied. In order to do that, add this to your configuration files such as .bashrc: 12345alias socks='ALL_PROXY=socks5://127.0.0.1:1080/ \\ http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:1080/ \\ https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:1080/ \\ HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:1080/ \\ HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:1080/' source the file, and you can run socks to set all application to bypass proxy, or you can run things like socks wget to use it per command. And some more things Now, let’s talk about Shadowsocks R and GFW. GFW is banning more and more IP, and my Google Cloud Server did not survive too. It is harder and harder to use VPN in China, and more are banned, even include the VPN and VDI of my school (It is now fine, seems they just pollute the IP). I have been never this angry. If they really have to blame westerners not giving them the latest technology, just look at themselves. They block CRAN. They block Tensorflow. They corrupt Ubuntu, Debian, PiPY and OpenSUSE’s server. Programmers, engineers, data scientists and students like me need a reliable connection to reach latest technologies, and you know what? They block them, how funny it is. What? You say using Ali or PKU server? No, I will not. They are unsafe, with limited packages. Ubuntu archive server in China is not even with the Official archive server. It’s NOT reliable. Deepin? They even cannot survive. CEO just quit several months ago, and using Deepin makes you fell into the dependency hell. “Azure Powered By 21Vianet”, “iCloud in Guizhou”, “China LinkedIn”, big corporation compromised. But for small individuals, we have a choice. Shadowsocks R® is still the most reliable way to bypassing GFW, sadly Shadowsocks R is so dead. Shadowsocks is saved by community, and the author of SSRR is criticized because a propaganda the author made. It’s hard to bypass GFW, but you know what? Life is also hard. deal with it.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"SSR","slug":"SSR","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/SSR/"},{"name":"Server","slug":"Server","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Server/"}]},{"title":"旅游·冒险","slug":"travel-adventure","date":"2018-06-11T10:14:04.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/06/11/travel-adventure/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2018/06/11/travel-adventure/","excerpt":"人生如果不是一場美好的冒險，那就什麼也不是了。 海倫·凱勒 五個月的美國交換之旅，是我獨自一人的旅遊。這是一場冒險。紐約，羅拉，芝加哥，聖路易斯，西雅圖。遇到不曾遇到的人，體驗從沒有過的經歷，感受不一樣的文化。 不同於大陸，不同於香港。這是一個全新的國度，一個陌生的世界。","text":"人生如果不是一場美好的冒險，那就什麼也不是了。 海倫·凱勒 五個月的美國交換之旅，是我獨自一人的旅遊。這是一場冒險。紐約，羅拉，芝加哥，聖路易斯，西雅圖。遇到不曾遇到的人，體驗從沒有過的經歷，感受不一樣的文化。 不同於大陸，不同於香港。這是一個全新的國度，一個陌生的世界。 12月29日，初到美國。新澤西州紐瓦克，機場。打出租車，到達紐約。這是一座大都會，整齊編號的道路，高聳入雲的大樓，以及迎接我的皚皚白雪。一週的放縱遊蕩，我享受到了孤獨的自由。 1月5日，暴風雪襲紐約城。全城白雪茫茫，寸步難行。在路上，你完全無法行動，大風嘩嘩地無情地往臉上捶打着。整座城，被雪困住了。前往聖路易斯的航班，取消。我被困住了。加住一天，改機票，退車票，換車票。遇到一個心情不好的車站職員，換錯了三次票。她一臉不爽的看着我離開車站。第二天，早早起牀，趕上巴士，離開了這座仍被白色覆蓋的世界級大都市。 1月7日，在機場瑟瑟發抖的趕上了大巴。在寒冷的冬夜，我到達了學校。學校的生活，開始了。圖靈機，普萊西訴弗格森案；文件系統，計算機語法；美利堅合眾國憲法第十三條修正案，RAID；自動機理論，Lisp。學校的生活，緊張又刺激。 節日和各式活動，充實了在緊張學習中的我。3月底，聖帕特里克節，春休，一場狂歡，與一場芝加哥之旅。2月的國際學生聯歡會，4月的聖路易斯大球場和動物園之旅，讓我交到了不少朋友。我不再像以前一樣迷茫。我知道我在做什麼。 5月11日，學期結束。結束了。但我的旅程並未結束。一週後，我來到了華盛頓州的雷德蒙德，找到了朋友。説是朋友，其實是我六年前的寄宿家庭———但是，我們的關係，卻提升到了朋友。她帶我到西雅圖周邊地區玩——史魁恩，湯森港，杜瓦爾，詹姆斯城，甘博港，旗堡國家公園。見了她的摯友，見了未曾想到的人。這是一次全新的體驗——從心底裏的讚歎，不愧是常綠之州。 一週的旅行，很快就結束了。五個月的美國交換之旅，畫上了句號。這場冒險，卻只是人生中的逗號。“人生如果不是一場美好的冒險，那就什麼也不是了。”是的，人生就是一場冒險，如果不是，你只是在混混沌沌的過日子；人生，要敢闖，不退縮，才是人生。今年，我要考研究生，準備畢業論文。我的人生冒險，才剛開始。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Write-ups","slug":"Write-ups","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Write-ups/"}]},{"title":"forcely enable Sets in Windows 10 Insider Preview","slug":"forcely-enable-Sets-in-Windows-10-Insider-Preview","date":"2018-05-26T17:30:40.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/05/26/forcely-enable-Sets-in-Windows-10-Insider-Preview/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2018/05/26/forcely-enable-Sets-in-Windows-10-Insider-Preview/","excerpt":"TL;DR This article is a more detailed tutorial comparing to this on reddit as it do not contain some of the important things to do before and after.

If we execute powershell.exe directly, code will not be executed directly.

Now, it is one of my most successful app with over 10k downloads. Looking back, this is the road of me improving from time to time. Now, Let me tell you the story behind UWP DevKit. Start UWP DevKit was originally made for my own personal use. At first, I didn’t want to go to the UWP Documentation every time when I wanted to find the proper Segoe MDL2 Assets font icon, so I implemented an ugly but usable feature Sogoe MDL2 Converter(Yes, I also spelled it wrong) in my private app MyHub. Soon I found that there were already apps available in Store that can help UWP devs get work done, but all of them are apps with only one feature like generating assets - I wanted an app that can help me complete all tasks. Hence, the very first version of UWP DevKit, Developer Tools For UWP, was born. Only three features(Segoe MDL2 icons, URI Tester, Assets Generator) were available, but at the time I could use one app for all the features, not three separate apps. Grow Soon, with the ambition, I released version 1.1.3 and 1.3.7 to enhance the app and brought multilingual support of Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese. I used Template 10 to make it look even better and more responsive. At the same time, I started to promote my app on AppRaisin, 智机网(wpxap, it business changed now) and 酷七网(coolxap, now bankrupted), and it was so effective, that the app had over 100 downloads per day at the time. But then I felt that this name was too long and needed a change. I rebranded the app to WeCode with change of logo to match my previous successful WP8.1 project WeFile. I am also not stopping from here – I started to enhance existing components with implement new features, but this time I hadn’t realize that, I was starting to get lost. Lost I thought, this is not enough. I tried to go even further. I tried to implement a new interface for WeCode multiple times, but it was always not what I want. I was expecting a interface that is like Microsoft Edge: tabs to switch between features, multiple instance can be opened individually in a window. All the results were not good-looking, and I hated myself so much. Also, at the period no new feature was added due to the massive design experiments. I also started to perform badly at school, so soon I lost my patience and abandoned the project. I messed up. Change last summer, things started to change. I decided to change myself, by picking up the app that people start to hate. At the time, crashes exists all the time, my app page filled with one star comments filled with my empty promises of “we will update in a future update”. I was sure I needed a change urgently. So, I made an important decision: do everything from scratch. I changed name to UWP DevKit, abandoned old frameworks, archived old git repository, created a new project file called WeCode-Next. To me, it is a restart of part of my life. The app start to shape as time went by, and it started to look good. Finally, at the summer of 2017, I released the first version of UWP DevKit 5.0, open sourced, with my heart. And it didn’t let me down. It was another success. And now, it goes back to the top of Developer Tools section. Here, I hope to thank you everyone who download and use the app, without your support, I cannot make to here. Thank you so much!

One example is English, where it has a continuing evolution on its grammar, vocabulary and expressions from its origin in 550CE as Proto-Germanic to Modern English nowadays. For example, word “husbandman”, an English word that came from Greek in 1300s, is a Middle English vocabulary that means “farmer”. (hus-bō̆nd-man, n.d.) However, people no longer use it now, because people use this word for describing a husband as a farmer in 1300s as most husbands at the time had a job as a farmer. Nowadays, “husband” do a lot more jobs other than farming, which eventually prevents using it. Similarly, discriminatory vocabulary was born as the social environment changed. If we eliminate these discriminatory terms from our languages, society will become less racist, sexist and less discriminatory, as the language speakers only think in the categories that the language provides. This will be asserted by demonstrating how linguistic determinism around the world impact on culture and by showing how the ethnocentrism and gender-fair language impact on people. One key point to support that elimination of discriminatory language helps creating a less discriminatory society is the impact of the linguistic relativism in culture. Benjamin Lee Whorf raised a hypothesis by researching Hopi and English, where Hopi have a huge difference comparing to English in terms of vocabulary (unparalleled word definition) and grammar (Hopi is timeless). This research discovered that the possible information loss or distortion between language translation due to culture difference. (Whorf, 1956) The hypothesis is called Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis, which language relativism is the weak form and generally accepted nowadays. Another example is Han characters in Japanese(Kanji) and Chinese(Hanzi), since they showed culture similarity and difference. For instance, “交通” shared same meaning in both languages, but for some like “結構” have different meanings, where in Japanese it means “well” but in Chinese it means “structure”. According to a research by Coulmas Florian, the meanings of Kanji start to diverge at the time of Meiji Period, there Japan experienced a rapid modernization while China is still ruled by emperor, which caused the change on language meanings and usages. In such way, the thoughts between Japanese start to diverge. (Coulmas, 1991) All of them showed that that linguistic relativism made it possible to change people’s thought and action by changing the language itself. The impact and solution of ethnocentrism is the other key point to support the discriminatory language elimination helps creating a more respectful society. Ethnocentrism is basically the general bias towards a group of people with certain properties, such as job, gender, race or nation. One example of ethnocentrism of language is gender stereotypes. For instance, a person would assume a policeman as male and a nurse as female by default, because “automatic sex categorization” from people’s expectation defined the duties, perspectives and preferred people group of job should be and eventually effect people’s belief on vocabulary itself, so that people will make such assumption. (Ridgeway, 2001) Nowadays, to make the language more neutral, the idea of Gender-Fair Language(GFL) is created by American Psychological Association, to make people’s daily vocabulary more genderless, and it is promoted in several languages which are mostly used in America and Europe. (American Psychological Association, 1975) According to a report done for USA National Institutes of Health, the use of GFL shows a vibrant reduction on gender stereotyping and discrimination in 15 years: public awareness for GFL has raised as the increasing discussion on GFL and gender-balanced representations of mentality in Swedish, German and America showed an emerging trend. (Sczesny, Formanowicz &amp; Moser, 2016) Such change shows that changing the vocabulary we use by guidelines, regulations and education do help us from discriminate or stereotype less without noticing. Besides the powerfulness of the language, language can be also dynamic, in such way, discriminatory terms will still be born after their elimination using ways like Gender-Neutral Language in a alternative way. However, I believe this will not be a concern. Firstly, the culture impact from language relativism is the major aspects that defines our thoughts. Language itself is dynamic, when a larger group of people starts to implement the new language, people will be eventually affected by the general language speaking environment. This process is slow, but when people changed their thoughts and beliefs, a new culture will be created based on the old culture and the language will enter a new era. For Example, the modernization of China and Culture changed China’s written and spoken language to the Chinese we speak nowadays. Secondly, actions of trying to create neutral speaking environment can effectively reduce ethnocentrism. Although language is dynamic and can recover its vocabulary, procedures such GFL, the example given previously, do showed people have generally changed their attitudes towards ethnocentrism. This means the ethnocentrism in language is not dynamic, it is almost linear, even the actions like GFL only accelerate the process a little, according to the report, (Sczesny, Formanowicz &amp; Moser, 2016) it still proves that there are possible solutions of creating neutral speaking environment has the impact on solving the ethnocentrism problem. Discriminatory actions can be can be reduced by eliminate discriminatory terms with help of continuing language determinism and elimination of ethnocentrism as shown by several researchers. In real life, the elimination of discriminatory terms is long and slow process with barriers, and its result are also going to show up gradually and unsteadily, but researches on elimination of the discriminatory terms like Gender-Fair Language are continuing, for creating a more equal environment for everyone.

Microsoft Corp., or called Microsoft Antitrust Case, where Microsoft is accused of becoming a monopoly by using anti-competitive practices. This event happened at the beginning of the Internet era, and in this case, Internet technologies including web browsers (Internet Explorer/Netscape) and Their Plugins (Java/ActiveX) are involved in this event. Microsoft is believed to use excessive unfair methods to stop people from using the products from its competitors such as web browsers like Netscape and Opera and web plugins like Java and to promote Microsoft’s own product, that is, Internet Explorer and ActiveX [1]. Web browser is born basically made it more accessible for public to access Internet faster, and web plugins help extend the basic functionality of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to be more interactive with animations, buttons and more. In the early age, they made browsing internet a lot easier, and more fun. Java is one of the representative at the time, it is one of the first “portable” programming language. With its mobility, it works on a lot of devices now including mobile phones, tablets, IoT devices, Portable software, etc., but because its ability of “Write Once, Run Anywhere” (WORA), it is widely used in webpages initially. [3] However, for Microsoft, this became a mistake. Java first collaborated with the Netscape web browser, and they started to become popular at the time. [4] Inside Microsoft, they are so nervous so that they needed a way to dominate the Internet market fast. So, they implement a few methods to achieve their goals, including bundling with Windows 95/98, providing financial help to Apple in return of using IE (Microsoft Internet Explorer) as their default web browser for MacOS, and making an internet plugin system called ActiveX similar to Java, according to the court record [1]. This movement soon made Microsoft won this Internet war, but this also raised the concern of misuse of market domination. In such concern, the lawsuit was filed by US Government to Microsoft. Microsoft lost eventually as I mentioned in my Pre-Debate Writeup and Post-Debate Summary. As requested by court, Microsoft must provide support for other platforms in terms of software and standards such as providing Microsoft Office suite for Mac OS and provide OLE standard support for both Linux and Mac OS; Also, they must provide several versions of windows requested by USA court and later other organizations [4] [5]: Windows LTS (For business), Windows N (For European market), Windows K (For South Korea Market), and Windows KN (For general). One important impact from this event is that a computer platform cannot use ways to try dominating the market or use their market domination to enforce some actions, and this event caused future lawsuits on similar events, such as Android, which is sued by European Commission in 2016 due to its domination in mobile phone market [6]. This eventually helped creating a better atmosphere in the software industry. This also helped people realized the possibility of pross-platform, and Java is mostly the number one programming language for a very long time. This also raised an issue that how companies should deal when their product dominates the market. Other than that, this event also starts a new trend of cross-platform application. As People at Oracle believe, Java is “Write Once, Run Anywhere”. This made it possible to bring applications on multiple platforms without the “Application Barrier of Entry”, and with the chance of the Microsoft Antitrust Case, cross-platform technology made “Application Barrier of Entry” of operating systems to start fading away. In recent years, cross-platform technologies are becoming widely used and implemented: Firstly, Python, then Mono Native, following with NodeJS, React Native and more. Even Microsoft introduces .NET Core, the cross-platform programming framework for people to use. [7] We can clearly see that in the future, programs will become more portable and extensive, and thus people have a better flexibility when choosing the platform. But another concern raised that how user should choose their platform when there is no “Application Barrier of Entry”. This conflict will be continuing in the future, and we can wait and see how it will be in the future. This course helped me identify this famous case and facts that I have not realized before. And I have already identified key ideas and start to take actions by moving my programming work from platform-limited applications like WPF framework and GNOME GTK framework to cross-platform ones like Python and Electron(NodeJS-based) frameworks. This helps me identify the transition and decide what framework in the future I should use to catch up the coming-up trends. References [1] U.S. v. Microsoft Corporation, vol. 253. 2001, p. 53.

Commands To see what cronjobs are currently running on your system, you can open a terminal and run: 1crontab -l To edit the list of elevated cronjobs, you need to run: 1crontab -e To remove your crontab file: 1crontab -r To display the last time you edited your crontab file: 1crontab -v One important thing is, DO NOT open crontab file on your own, which will possibly break the crontab deamon. Also, the crontab will begin running as soon as it is properly edited and saved. Syntax crontab has syntax of following: 1min hr dd mo wk com Where: min: minute (0-59) hr: hour (0-23, 0 = midnight) dd: day (1-31) mo: month (1-12) wk: weekday (0-6, 0 = Sunday) com: command to be executed An asterisk (*) can be used so that every instance (every hour, every weekday, every month, etc.) of a time period is used. Comma-separated values can be used to run more than one instance of a particular command within a time period. Hyphen-separated values can be used to run a command continuously. You may want to run a script some number of times per time unit, use */n where it runs every time that is divisible by n. Also, it is recommended that you use the full path to the desired commands as shown in the above examples. Exmaples 121 06 12 3 1 python &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;myfolder&#x2F;myscript.py The above example will run python /usr/bin/myfolder/myscript.py at 6:21 AM on March 12 plus every Monday in March. 121 06 * * * python &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;myfolder&#x2F;myscript.py The above example will run python /usr/bin/myfolder/myscript.py at 6:21 AM on every day of every month. 101,31 04,05 1-15 1,6 * python &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;myfolder&#x2F;myscript.py The above example will run python /usr/bin/myfolder/myscript.py at 01 and 31, past the hours of 4:00am and 5:00am on the 1st through the 15th of every January and June. 1*&#x2F;10 * * * * python &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;myfolder&#x2F;myscript.py The above example will run python /usr/bin/myfolder/myscript.py every 10 minutes. Special words For the first (minute) field, you can also put in a keyword instead of a number: @reboot: Run once, at startup @yearly: Run once a year “0 0 1 1 *” @annually: (same as @yearly) @monthly: Run once a month “0 0 1 * *” @weekly: Run once a week “0 0 * * 0” @daily: Run once a day “0 0 * * *” @midnight: (same as @daily) @hourly: Run once an hour “0 * * * *” Environment We should know that cron invokes the command from the user’s HOME directory with the shell, (/usr/bin/sh). cron supplies a default environment for every shell, defining: 1234HOME=user’s-home-directoryLOGNAME=user’s-login-idPATH=/usr/bin:/usr/sbinSHELL=/usr/bin/sh Users who desire to have their .profile executed must explicitly do so in the crontab entry or in a script called by the entry. Storing Output add &gt;&gt; /var/log/&lt;the name you want&gt;.log 2&gt;&amp;1 to the end of your command. Disable Email By default, cronjobs sends a email to the user account executing the cronjob. If this is not needed, then put &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 at the end of the cron job line. You can also configure crontab to forward all output to a real email address by starting your crontab with MAILTO=&quot;myname@somedomain.com&quot;. Storing Logs To collect the cron execution execution log in a file: 130 18 * * * rm &#x2F;home&#x2F;someuser&#x2F;tmp&#x2F;* &gt; &#x2F;home&#x2F;someuser&#x2F;cronlogs&#x2F;clean_tmp_dir.log","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Ubuntu","slug":"Ubuntu","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Ubuntu/"},{"name":"Server","slug":"Server","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Server/"}]},{"title":"Encoding problem in Python and how to solve it","slug":"python-encoding-issue","date":"2017-11-09T12:20:45.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/11/09/python-encoding-issue/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2017/11/09/python-encoding-issue/","excerpt":"I recently meet a bug that really annoys me when trying to make a web spider.

However, I got this: {&quot;description&quot;: &quot;The New Topographic photographers acknowledged people\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s interaction with... This is because Python parse string data into byte arrays, for example, People’ s will be converted to a bytestring of ['\\u0070', '\\u0065', '\\u006f', '\\u0070', \\u006c', '\\u0065', '\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099', '\\u0073']. When people try to read the bytestring as string, Python will not consider \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 as a single character but three seperate character.

The later values take precedence. It works with any number of JSON and YAML files with arbitrarily deep objects. Note that no spaces are allowed in the list. For instance, in the above example if foo: bar is in custom.yml, but &quot;foo&quot;: &quot;dinosaur&quot; is in custom2.json, _multiconfig.yml will contain foo: dinosaur.

Using C:\\Windows\\system32” When executing in shell script directly using cmd.exe or powershell.exe, sometimes this line will be popped up without knowing why. This is because cmd.exe and powershell.exe cannot translate the Linux path to Windows path. To solve this is actually pretty easy; just cd to a Windows path such as /mnt/c then execute cmd.exe or powershell.exe. Windows Application With Admin Privileges Some of the application cannot be called through Bash. Although Official Website do provide direct call of Windows Binary such as: 12/mnt/c/Windows/System32/cmd.exe /C dir/mnt/c/Windows/System32/PING.EXE www.microsoft.com However, this is not working if you want to execute apps that requires admin privileges.

Looking back, it is painful and long, which also shows I have a long way to be a better leader. In the past months, we had several meetings, which comes up with a diversity of ideas, which end up with 6 editions of the proposal(the 3rd and the 6th is online). The experience is not that good since we are from a range of backgrounds, we usually cannot have a timeslot in common, which made the project running slowly. During this time, we have two major problems: Fail to reach agreement too much as we have too much time conflict. This becomes a major conflict in my team, which wasted a lot of time. This leads to the bad time management in our coming event, which do have some negative effect to our progress. Ideas are too diverse. We originally set the topic as Shang Si Festival(Original of Girl’s Day in Japan), but we changed it multiple times. Things like this occurs too much, and what we can see is that it is too time-consuming for us. In order to solve the problem, we simplifies the process and held meeting on Skype in order to get the best use of the event, while we stop doing things that waste time such as the time for the meeting. However, during these meeting, I am also benefits from the process: Enjoy diversity. In my team, there are students from a diverse of background, which they might be not in the same grade, or even some of them are postgraduates, Masters and MScs. I get more chance to know people from different background, and I am able to accept people more with a totally different background. Learn from others through meetings. Through the process, we find out that we have different advantages that we can learned from, and we understand each other more when we do that. Importance of prototyping. The prototyping really helped us to change what our target group what to know. This really helps us from making the right decision on our project.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"REDBird","slug":"REDBird","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/REDBird/"},{"name":"MSSS","slug":"MSSS","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/MSSS/"},{"name":"Reflection","slug":"Reflection","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Reflection/"},{"name":"SDLP","slug":"SDLP","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/SDLP/"}]},{"title":"启用Surface Book上Ubuntu的触屏","slug":"ubuntu-touch-surfacebook-cn","date":"2017-03-16T13:49:48.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/03/16/ubuntu-touch-surfacebook-cn/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2017/03/16/ubuntu-touch-surfacebook-cn/","excerpt":"","text":"我以前曾经尝试着启用Surface Book上Ubuntu的触屏但是失败了。幸运的是，有人发现了启用触屏的方法。。。针对于Surface Pro 4的。 但基于他的方法，我进行了一些修改，成功的启用了Surface Book上Ubuntu的触屏。现在除了休眠时会睡死，一切正常。 在此，我会使用/u/cantenna1的kernel。 从Reddit /r/SurfaceLinux上的文章进行整理，修改和翻译。 1.压缩硬盘空间 右键开始菜单-&gt;磁盘管理，接着右键C盘分区，选择压缩卷，压缩至你想要用的大小（我的最多可压缩至120GB）。 2.创建Ubuntu引导盘 参见http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows 3.插入外接键鼠（可选） 键盘和触控板在安装和后续步骤是会不可用， 所以你需要插入外接键鼠。如果你闲的蛋疼，你可以使用Ubuntu安装盘内置的OnBoard键盘（设置-&gt; 通用辅助功能-&gt; 打字 -&gt; 屏幕键盘) 4.从USB启动并安装Ubuntu 关闭Surface， 按住电源和音量上键进入BIOS。修改启动顺序，使U盘先启动。 然后可以从U盘启动了。虽然原作者在安装时全部选择了默认选项，我还是建议进行自己分区（将/boot进行独立分区）以防止破坏EFI分区（不要问我为什么知道的，血的教训啊）。 5.安装Kernel 现在，你可以正常进入Ubuntu了。但是，现在还是有很多问题，比如键鼠不能用。你现在需要使用新的Kernel。我个人使用的是/u/cantenna1的kernel： 这个kernel可以触屏，但是物理键会无法使用。同时，外接显示器会有严重的显示问题。 更加详细的资料片可查看https://www.reddit.com/r/SurfaceLinux/comments/4vbzki/androidx86_with_the_new_ipts_driver/d5xs969 和其中/u/cantenna1与/u/arda_coskunses的评论。详细的触屏支持请查看https://github.com/ipts-linux-org/ipts-linux/wiki。WiFi驱动来自https://github.com/matthewwardrop/linux-surfacepro3/blob/master/wifi.patch 。 安装的话，请下载https://mega.nz/#!nJJ2DSJZ!4BYSRvzp3hb6NxU5X6_38xFkpuUEmSNvRo2px2TCDqc并解压文件。 打开终端，cd到文件夹并输入以下指令： 12sudo dpkg -i './linux-headers-4.4.0-rc8touchkernel+_1_amd64.deb'sudo dpkg -i './linux-image-4.4.0-rc8touchkernel+_1_amd64.deb' 6.拷贝触屏驱动 要让触屏工作，我们需要Windows分区的触屏驱动。我们需要将这些文件从Windows分区拷贝到Ubuntu分区，以保证可以找到驱动。 注：如果你找不到或者删掉了Windows分区的话你可以从此下载https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49498。选择zip格式，然后你可以在Drivers/System/SurfaceTouchServicingML下找到触屏驱动。 首先确保你的Windows分区已经挂载（最简单的方法是在资源管理器里直接挂载）。现在在根目录创建名为itouch的文件夹，并将驱动拷贝进去。 12sudo mkdir /itouchsudo cp /media/用户名/磁盘名/Windows/INF/PreciseTouch/Intel/* /itouch 你现在需要创建链接使驱动可以被搜索到。 1234sudo ln -sf /itouch/SurfaceTouchServicingKernelSKLMSHW0076.bin /itouch/vendor_kernel_skl.binsudo ln -sf /itouch/SurfaceTouchServicingSFTConfigMSHW0076.bin /itouch/integ_sft_cfg_skl.binsudo ln -sf /itouch/SurfaceTouchServicingDescriptorMSHW0076.bin /itouch/vendor_descriptor.binsudo ln -sf /itouch/iaPreciseTouchDescriptor.bin /itouch/integ_descriptor.bin 7.修改默认Kernel 所有驱动已经安装完，但是系统不一定会启动到正确的Kernel。你可以在启动时在grub手动选择Advanced options for Ubuntu -&gt; Ubuntu, with Linux 4.4.0-rc8touchkernel+。要改变默认的Kernel你需要修改grub（我用的是-customizer: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/43471/how-to-configure-the-linux-grub2-boot-menu-the-easy-way/)。 8.防止自动休眠 一旦休眠，你的电脑会睡的死死的。要防止盖上后自动休眠，输入以下指令： 1sudo gedit /etc/UPower/UPower.conf 然后把IgnoreLid=false改成IgnoreLid=true。 对于Gnome，你需要在gnome-tweak-tool关闭休眠。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Linux","slug":"Linux","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Linux/"},{"name":"Ubuntu","slug":"Ubuntu","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Ubuntu/"},{"name":"Surface","slug":"Surface","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Surface/"}]},{"title":"Enable touch on Ubuntu on Surface Book 启用Surface Book上Ubuntu的触屏","slug":"ubuntu-touch-surfacebook","date":"2017-03-16T13:49:48.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/03/16/ubuntu-touch-surfacebook/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2017/03/16/ubuntu-touch-surfacebook/","excerpt":"I used to try to enable the touch screen on Surface Book but failed.

Fortunately, someone find out a way to enable touch… on Surface Pro 4. Using his idea with some modification, I successfully enabled touch on Surface Book. Now everything work except hibernating system since it sleeps like dead. I will be using /u/cantenna1’s kernel in this post. Retrived from post in Reddit /r/SurfaceLinux and modified 1.Shrink the windows partition Right click Start -&gt; Disk Management. Then right click on the windows partition and go shrink volume and reduce it as much as it will let you (Mine let me shrink to 120 GB). 2.Make a bootable Ubuntu usb drive See http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows 3.Plug in a usb hub The keyboard and touch pad won’t work for the next few steps so I needed a usb hub to plug in a usb keyboard, mouse and the bootable usb drive. Or if you think you are not tired or you are bored, you can use on screen typing with OnBoard built-in Ubuntu Installer(Settings -&gt; Universal Access -&gt; Typing -&gt; OnScreen Keyboard) 4.Boot from usb and install Ubuntu Turn the surface off and then hold the volume down button while powering on to boot to BIOS. There change the boot order so that usb drives boot before the internal drive. then you should be able to boot off the Ubuntu usb stick now. Although the original writer chose all the default options and installed alongside windows, I personally suggest using custom drive partition, i.e, separate /boot to prevent direct corruption to the system EFI partition. 5.Install a patched kernel You should hopefully now be able to boot to a working Ubuntu, albeit with a ton of issues (no keyboard / touch pad among other things). You now have to update the kernel to one that has support for these features. I personally uses /u/cantenna1’s kernel. This kernel gets the touchscreen working, but the physical buttons will not work and the i915 GuC version used is a little buggy and caused me some issues with external monitors. Further details on this kernel can be found in this post https://www.reddit.com/r/SurfaceLinux/comments/4vbzki/androidx86_with_the_new_ipts_driver/d5xs969 and in the comments by /u/cantenna1 and /u/arda_coskunses in this post. Details on the patch for the touch support can be found at https://github.com/ipts-linux-org/ipts-linux/wiki. The patch for WIFI is from https://github.com/matthewwardrop/linux-surfacepro3/blob/master/wifi.patch. To install the kernel download this file https://mega.nz/#!nJJ2DSJZ!4BYSRvzp3hb6NxU5X6_38xFkpuUEmSNvRo2px2TCDqc and extract its contents. Now open a terminal cd to the location of the files and install them by going 12sudo dpkg -i './linux-headers-4.4.0-rc8touchkernel+_1_amd64.deb'sudo dpkg -i './linux-image-4.4.0-rc8touchkernel+_1_amd64.deb' 6.Copy binary files needed by the touch drivers To work, the touch drivers need some information stored in binaries on your windows partition. You now need to copy them over to the Ubuntu partition and ensure the drivers can find them. Note: If you cannot find the files or have deleted your windows partition you can download them here https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49498. Select the zip download option and once downloaded you will find the files in the Drivers/System/SurfaceTouchServicingML folder. To do this first ensure your windows partition is mounted (the easiest way to do this is just to open it in the files browser). Now create a folder named ‘itouch’ in your root directory and copy the binaries to it 12sudo mkdir /itouchsudo cp /media/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/YOUR_DRIVE_NAME_HERE/Windows/INF/PreciseTouch/Intel/* /itouch You now need to create links to the files giving them names that match what the driver will search for 1234sudo ln -sf /itouch/SurfaceTouchServicingKernelSKLMSHW0076.bin /itouch/vendor_kernel_skl.binsudo ln -sf /itouch/SurfaceTouchServicingSFTConfigMSHW0076.bin /itouch/integ_sft_cfg_skl.binsudo ln -sf /itouch/SurfaceTouchServicingDescriptorMSHW0076.bin /itouch/vendor_descriptor.binsudo ln -sf /itouch/iaPreciseTouchDescriptor.bin /itouch/integ_descriptor.bin 7.Change the kernel that boots by default Everything is now installed, however there is a good chance that your laptop won’t boot the right kernel by default. You can select it manually in grub at boot by going Advanced options for Ubuntu -&gt; Ubuntu, with Linux 4.4.0-rc8touchkernel+. To switch out the default you will need to edit grub (I did this with grub-customizer http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/43471/how-to-configure-the-linux-grub2-boot-menu-the-easy-way/ followed by sudo update-grub) 8.Prevent the laptop suspending when the lid closes. Once suspended it currently cannot wake, to get around this I prevent closing the lid from doing anything. To do this go 1sudo gedit /etc/UPower/UPower.conf and change IgnoreLid=false to IgnoreLid=true. For GNOME, you also have to turn off the suspending in the gnome-tweak-tool.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Linux","slug":"Linux","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Linux/"},{"name":"Ubuntu","slug":"Ubuntu","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Ubuntu/"},{"name":"Surface","slug":"Surface","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Surface/"}]},{"title":"MSSS攝影大賽計劃書（第三版）","slug":"MSSS-photograph-competition","date":"2017-03-15T16:20:45.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.304Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/03/15/MSSS-photograph-competition/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2017/03/15/MSSS-photograph-competition/","excerpt":"比賽內容：對香港的城市風景以及自然風光的攝影 預期成果: 提升同學對香港的認識，鼓勵學生走出大學學園去瞭解香港，同時豐富會員的課餘活動，培養同學的興趣愛好","text":"比賽內容：對香港的城市風景以及自然風光的攝影 預期成果: 提升同學對香港的認識，鼓勵學生走出大學學園去瞭解香港，同時豐富會員的課餘活動，培養同學的興趣愛好 比賽時間：4月1-15日 最後作品提交時間：4月15日 晚上11點 比賽人數：50 比賽規則： 比賽為雙軌制，可以 自由拍攝提交作品； 跟隨預設的一些活動進行攝影，並提交作品。 與行山俱樂部合作，組織一到兩次預設的活動。已確認活動： 大美督-沙田騎行（4月8日或9日） 路線：大美督 → 大埔海濱公園 → 吐露港單車徑 → 白石角海濱長廊 → 香港科學園 → 城門河 全程：3 小時 人數：25 人以下 行程：中午12點從科大出發，乘坐大巴至大美督, 大約一小時 (google map)。稍作遊覽2點從大美 督騎行出發，分組沿著騎行路徑向沙田進發 (車隊前後需有 MSSS 執委)。約 4 小時到達沙田。解散或者自行約飯 Budget：租車費用約 60-80HKD/人次，大巴費用約 700HKD，補給 300HKD. 待辦事項： 租車商戶、費用確認 大巴、費用確認 採購，宣傳，報名費收取 遠足類活動（待定） 以郵件的方式提交作品，其中需包括： 作品原稿（可使用HDR，但不准使用濾鏡） 注：單反相機作品無需提交CR2原圖文件 拍攝作品使用設備（手機請同時注明使用的是原生相機應用還是第三方應用） 作品標題（&lt;15字） 作品簡介（可選，50字以下） 聯絡方式 評選：4月16至20日，在微信、MSSS網站（預選：Qualtrics/Google Form）進行投票活動，選出最喜歡三個作品，獲得票數最高者贏得比賽。 截至：4月20日晚上8點 4月21-22日，整理資料，並公佈最終得獎名單 通知獲獎人前往領取獎勵","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"REDBird","slug":"REDBird","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/REDBird/"},{"name":"SDLP","slug":"SDLP","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/SDLP/"},{"name":"Proposal","slug":"Proposal","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Proposal/"}]},{"title":"Reflection on MSSS Inauguration Dinner 2017","slug":"MSSS-Inauguration-Dinner-2017-Reflection","date":"2017-03-06T23:28:49.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.304Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/03/06/MSSS-Inauguration-Dinner-2017-Reflection/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2017/03/06/MSSS-Inauguration-Dinner-2017-Reflection/","excerpt":"Recently, I helped organize the event for the MSSS. it is a inauguration dinner event collaborating with FooPar, a startup food delivering service from HKUST.","text":"Recently, I helped organize the event for the MSSS. it is a inauguration dinner event collaborating with FooPar, a startup food delivering service from HKUST. However, during the event, we find out that a lot of things is not conducted,including purchasing the necessary items as well as preparation for the utensils. Also, we have a conflict just before the event with FooPar, which causes a lot of trouble. The miscommunication causes the food they delivered is not enough for all the people who attend the event, which even made some of our workers angry. Also, they claimed that they cannot provide things including utensils, which we have to purchase them by ourselves just before the event. After the event is complete, we held the other activities including making dumplings as well as making paper lantern, but the situation was still a chaos, which made it difficult for us to arrange it properly. It ends with a mess, and we forget we still have one lucky draw remains. After this event, I think I the two area, we have a problem: Communication between FooBar. We get to know some of the information, such as signing a contract just before the event begins with unreasonable content, and told us they will not provide utensils when getting the delivered food. This shows we do not have enough effort to keep in touch with them. The Time Management. We are not able to help manage the things, which cancel our original plan for Yuanxiao Festival, and we have to done most of the things in 3 days, which is a hurry for us.

However, this will be no longer a problem by using alwsl. alwsl is a tool to install Arch Linux as the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) host. WSL-Distribution-Switcher https://github.com/RoliSoft/WSL-Distribution-Switcher This is an set of python Scripts to replace the distribution behind Windows Subsystem for Linux with any other Linux distribution published on Docker Hub. It support a wild range of Distribution including Fedora, Debian, CentOS and more. Jekyll Installer For WSL https://github.com/patrick330602/Jekyll-Installer-For-WSL Install Jekyll can be hard in WSL, since Ruby cannot be installed properly using rvm or apt-get. I personally wrote this script for install Jekyll easier with one line of code. Hexo Installer For WSL https://github.com/patrick330602/Hexo-Installer-For-WSL Just like Jekyll, Hexo also cannot be installed using normal method, with nvm or apt-get. Again, I personally wrote this script for install Hexo easier with one line of code. But be careful that this script is not supported in Build 15031 due to a known bug.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"WSL","slug":"WSL","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/WSL/"},{"name":"Ubuntu","slug":"Ubuntu","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Ubuntu/"},{"name":"Windows","slug":"Windows","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Windows/"}]},{"title":"/r/SurfaceLinux Wallpaper","slug":"surfacelinux-wallpaper","date":"2017-02-20T10:46:45.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/02/20/surfacelinux-wallpaper/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2017/02/20/surfacelinux-wallpaper/","excerpt":"SurfaceLinux: Penguins like nice things too.

This is possibly due to 2 problems: Time Management. We are not able to help manage everything with only three people since it is not a small activity that only need one person. Also, due to the failure of seeking funding, it is a headache to promoting our project. Low show-up rate. For this I think this is possibly because it is about the final and no one would like to show up to waste their time on such thing. Also, people also possibly embarrassed that they are not looking good to dance with others. In order to solve this, I have following solutions: Planning earlier. If we can plan early, we can easily consider all the situations so we can prepare better when we have unexpected event to happen; The topic can be further discussed so that it can be attractive to people more and reduce people’s so-called embarrassment on the people.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"REDBird","slug":"REDBird","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/REDBird/"},{"name":"MSSS","slug":"MSSS","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/MSSS/"},{"name":"Reflection","slug":"Reflection","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Reflection/"},{"name":"SDLP","slug":"SDLP","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/SDLP/"}]},{"title":"The Trip To OCS","slug":"OCS-trip","date":"2016-12-22T13:34:01.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.304Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/12/22/OCS-trip/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2016/12/22/OCS-trip/","excerpt":"Recently, I am lucky enough to get a chance to attend a convention called OCS with Chinese Students and Scholars Association of Hong Kong.

My project is called Deep Into Hong Kong. it is a project for mainly target to non-local students but not limited to local students, which, they can photograph, record or write about Hong Kong, to win this competition. This project is intend to help non-local students to dive deep into Hong Kong and Hong Kong people’s life, and they can have a deeper understanding of Hong Kong. We will set up 3 categories and 1 winner and 2 runner-ups in each categories. This project is very broad and hard to control the topic. Hence, I just give a topic of the most heart-touching moment they see, living in Hong Kong. From 4 trainings, I realize the importance of influencing others and, the most important part, to motivate others. This is really important as a leader. Thus, I have two SMARTe goals to set today: Good Time Management. Able to be motivative. Build Good Relationship with others. In order to achieve it, I have following plans: I want to schedule the time table for my work and complete and finalize within this month of November 2016. This will help us manage our time smartly without clashing each others’ timetable. More specific activity held schedule will be discussed around January and February 2017 as the semester timetable has changed. This will help us to gain our vision on smart time management. 2.I want to be able to complete this activity between March and May. To do that, I have to be a good leader to motivate people to do, to increase our efficiency. We will have a reflection of our work each month starting from November to push ourselves to achieve our goals. I will meet different person during my project as well as my life. I will try to build relationship and become friends if possible but not to avoid it. I hope I can be more out-going in the end of the projects.

The cheating on emission tests caused distrust of public and governments and all of this consequences leads from two factors: Technology factor and regulatory factor. But technology factor is the underlying cause of the Volkswagen Emission Scandal. The action and reaction from Volkswagen Group indicates their violation of WFEO Model Codes of Ethical [3]. The unprofessionalism of engineers is one of the main factor. Start in 2009 model year, Volkswagen started to migrate turbocharged direct injection(TDI) diesel engines to the new common-rail fuel injection(CFI) diesel engines, which is more precise amount of fuel deliver, higher fuel injection pressure, and better control of emissions, according to [4]. A diesel particulate filter is also installed to the capture root of most model of vehicles while some models use a urea-based exhaust aftertreatment system along with the new engine, which is claimed cleaner emissions than US requirements while deliver high performance to users [5]. Sadly, the new system fails to keep good fuel economy while having low NOx emissions as they advertised, so they decided to cheat by programming an engine control to toggle low-emission compliant mode while an emissions test is undergoing [6]. The actual emission can be as high as 38 times the lab result [7]. This means engineers practiced with an unaccepted method to make public feel that they are responsible for the health and value for the public, which should not be allowed. This is clearly violating WFEO Model Codes of Ethical 4.2, which give engineers obligations and responsibility to the public environment and health when they act. The lack of regulation between the corporation is also a main cause. Although the engineer decided to cheat in the emission test, at least 30 people in the corporation at management level know the situation and denied the existence of this problem [8], while the corporation claim initially it is just a “mere technical glitches” when the cheating is disclosed and insist this idea for a year until the full report is released by United States Environmental Protection Agency [9]. These shows a weak regulation and the disability of immediate reaction to the emergency situation inside the Volkswagen Group, which they lack the most. They covered their mistake when an unsuitable and harmful practice is being undertaken, which WFEO Model Codes of Ethical 1.2 and 1.3 can be applied to, since an engineer should be trustful and honest to their clients and to the general public as people have right to know more about their purchased vehicles. Among the Ethical codes, the violation of WFEO Model Codes of Ethical 4.2 can be extremely damaging. With the current high-emission system Volkswagen uses, it is estimated approximately 59 more premature deaths occurred during 2008 and 2015[ 10 ]. And it caused excess 45,000 disability-adjusted life years and lives lost which totally worth 39 billion US dollars[ 11]. The data has proved the severe damages to the health of the general public as well as the environment. In conclusion, the cheating on emission tests not only harmed the public right to know, but also the public health and environment, while two factors of technical problems and regulatory problems leads to whole Volkswagen Group to cheat with no turn-back. This kind of action should not have been taken and cannot be taken ever again to harm public benefits.

Color categories and physical specifications of color are also associated with objects, materials, light sources, etc., based on their physical properties such as light absorption, reflection, or emission spectra. Color definition, Wikipedia. Colorimetry is the science that describes colors in numbers, or provides a physical color match using a variety of measurement instruments. Colorimetry is used in chemistry, and in industries such as color printing, textile manufacturing, paint manufacturing and in the food industry. Colorimetry definition, Wikipedia. Then, how can we display colors as numbers? the answer: color models. Color Models RGB (Red Green Blue) The RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color model is the most known, and the most used every day. It defines a color space in terms of three components: Red, which ranges from 0-255 Green, which ranges from 0-255 Blue, which ranges from 0-255 The RGB color model is an additive one. In other words, Red, Green and Blue values (known as the three primary colors) are combined to reproduce other colors. For example, the color “Red” can be represented as [R=255, G=0, B=0], “Violet” as [R=238, G=130, B=238], etc. Its common graphic representation is the following image: In .NET, the Color structure use this model to provide color support through R, G and B properties. 12345678910Console.WriteLine(String.Format(\"R=&#123;0&#125;, G=&#123;1&#125;, B=&#123;2&#125;\", Color.Red.R, Color.Red.G, Color.Red.B);Console.WriteLine(String.Format(\"R=&#123;0&#125;, G=&#123;1&#125;, B=&#123;2&#125;\", Color.Cyan.R, Color.Cyan.G, Color.Cyan.B);Console.WriteLine(String.Format(\"R=&#123;0&#125;, G=&#123;1&#125;, B=&#123;2&#125;\", Color.White.R, Color.White.G, Color.White.B);Console.WriteLine(String.Format(\"R=&#123;0&#125;, G=&#123;1&#125;, B=&#123;2&#125;\", Color.SteelBlue.R, Color.SteelBlue.G, Color.SteelBlue.B);// etc... but this is not its only usage. For this reason, we can define a dedicated RGB structure for further coding, as shown below: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384858687888990919293949596/// &lt;summary&gt;/// RGB structure./// &lt;/summary&gt;public struct RGB&#123; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets an empty RGB structure; /// &lt;/summary&gt; public static readonly RGB Empty = new RGB(); private int red; private int green; private int blue; public static bool operator ==(RGB item1, RGB item2) &#123; return ( item1.Red == item2.Red &amp;&amp; item1.Green == item2.Green &amp;&amp; item1.Blue == item2.Blue ); &#125; public static bool operator !=(RGB item1, RGB item2) &#123; return ( item1.Red != item2.Red || item1.Green != item2.Green || item1.Blue != item2.Blue ); &#125; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets or sets red value. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public int Red &#123; get &#123; return red; &#125; set &#123; red = (value&gt;255)? 255 : ((value&lt;0)?0 : value); &#125; &#125; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets or sets red value. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public int Green &#123; get &#123; return green; &#125; set &#123; green = (value&gt;255)? 255 : ((value&lt;0)?0 : value); &#125; &#125; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets or sets red value. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public int Blue &#123; get &#123; return blue; &#125; set &#123; blue = (value&gt;255)? 255 : ((value&lt;0)?0 : value); &#125; &#125; public RGB(int R, int G, int B) &#123; this.red = (R&gt;255)? 255 : ((R&lt;0)?0 : R); this.green = (G&gt;255)? 255 : ((G&lt;0)?0 : G); this.blue = (B&gt;255)? 255 : ((B&lt;0)?0 : B); &#125; public override bool Equals(Object obj) &#123; if(obj==null || GetType()!=obj.GetType()) return false; return (this == (RGB)obj); &#125; public override int GetHashCode() &#123; return Red.GetHashCode() ^ Green.GetHashCode() ^ Blue.GetHashCode(); &#125;&#125; HSB color space The HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) color model defines a color space in terms of three constituent components: Hue : the color type (such as red, blue, or yellow). Ranges from 0 to 360° in most applications. (each value corresponds to one color : 0 is red, 45 is a shade of orange and 55 is a shade of yellow). Saturation : the intensity of the color. Ranges from 0 to 100% (0 means no color, that is a shade of grey between black and white; 100 means intense color). Also sometimes called the “purity” by analogy to the colorimetric quantities excitation purity. Brightness (or Value) : the brightness of the color. Ranges from 0 to 100% (0 is always black; depending on the saturation, 100 may be white or a more or less saturated color). Its common graphic representation is the following image: The HSB model is also known as HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) model. The HSV model was created in 1978 by Alvy Ray Smith. It is a nonlinear transformation of the RGB color space. In other words, color is not defined as a simple combination (addition/substraction) of primary colors but as a mathematical transformation. Note: HSV and HSB are the same, but HSL is different. All this said, a HSB structure can be : 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384858687888990919293949596979899100101102103/// &lt;summary&gt;/// Structure to define HSB./// &lt;/summary&gt;public struct HSB&#123; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets an empty HSB structure; /// &lt;/summary&gt; public static readonly HSB Empty = new HSB(); private double hue; private double saturation; private double brightness; public static bool operator ==(HSB item1, HSB item2) &#123; return ( item1.Hue == item2.Hue &amp;&amp; item1.Saturation == item2.Saturation &amp;&amp; item1.Brightness == item2.Brightness ); &#125; public static bool operator !=(HSB item1, HSB item2) &#123; return ( item1.Hue != item2.Hue || item1.Saturation != item2.Saturation || item1.Brightness != item2.Brightness ); &#125; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets or sets the hue component. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public double Hue &#123; get &#123; return hue; &#125; set &#123; hue = (value&gt;360)? 360 : ((value&lt;0)?0:value); &#125; &#125; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets or sets saturation component. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public double Saturation &#123; get &#123; return saturation; &#125; set &#123; saturation = (value&gt;1)? 1 : ((value&lt;0)?0:value); &#125; &#125; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets or sets the brightness component. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public double Brightness &#123; get &#123; return brightness; &#125; set &#123; brightness = (value&gt;1)? 1 : ((value&lt;0)? 0 : value); &#125; &#125; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Creates an instance of a HSB structure. /// &lt;/summary&gt; /// &lt;param name=\"h\"&gt;Hue value.&lt;/param&gt; /// &lt;param name=\"s\"&gt;Saturation value.&lt;/param&gt; /// &lt;param name=\"b\"&gt;Brightness value.&lt;/param&gt; public HSB(double h, double s, double b) &#123; hue = (h&gt;360)? 360 : ((h&lt;0)?0:h); saturation = (s&gt;1)? 1 : ((s&lt;0)?0:s); brightness = (b&gt;1)? 1 : ((b&lt;0)?0:b); &#125; public override bool Equals(Object obj) &#123; if(obj==null || GetType()!=obj.GetType()) return false; return (this == (HSB)obj); &#125; public override int GetHashCode() &#123; return Hue.GetHashCode() ^ Saturation.GetHashCode() ^ Brightness.GetHashCode(); &#125;&#125; HSL color space The HSL color space, also called HLS or HSI, stands for: Hue : the color type (such as red, blue, or yellow). Ranges from 0 to 360° in most applications (each value corresponds to one color : 0 is red, 45 is a shade of orange and 55 is a shade of yellow). Saturation : variation of the color depending on the lightness. Ranges from 0 to 100% (from the center of the black&amp;white axis). Lightness (also Luminance or Luminosity or Intensity). Ranges from 0 to 100% (from black to white). Its common graphic representation is the following image: HSL is similar to HSB. The main difference is that HSL is symmetrical to lightness and darkness. This means that: In HSL, the Saturation component always goes from fully saturated color to the equivalent gray (in HSB, with B at maximum, it goes from saturated color to white). In HSL, the Lightness always spans the entire range from black through the chosen hue to white (in HSB, the B component only goes half that way, from black to the chosen hue). For my part, HSL offers a more accurate (even if it’s not absolute) color approximation than HSB. All this said, a HSL structure can be: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384858687888990919293949596979899100101102103 /// &lt;summary&gt;/// Structure to define HSL./// &lt;/summary&gt;public struct HSL&#123; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets an empty HSL structure; /// &lt;/summary&gt; public static readonly HSL Empty = new HSL(); private double hue; private double saturation; private double luminance; public static bool operator ==(HSL item1, HSL item2) &#123; return ( item1.Hue == item2.Hue &amp;&amp; item1.Saturation == item2.Saturation &amp;&amp; item1.Luminance == item2.Luminance ); &#125; public static bool operator !=(HSL item1, HSL item2) &#123; return ( item1.Hue != item2.Hue || item1.Saturation != item2.Saturation || item1.Luminance != item2.Luminance ); &#125; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets or sets the hue component. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public double Hue &#123; get &#123; return hue; &#125; set &#123; hue = (value&gt;360)? 360 : ((value&lt;0)?0:value); &#125; &#125; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets or sets saturation component. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public double Saturation &#123; get &#123; return saturation; &#125; set &#123; saturation = (value&gt;1)? 1 : ((value&lt;0)?0:value); &#125; &#125; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets or sets the luminance component. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public double Luminance &#123; get &#123; return luminance; &#125; set &#123; luminance = (value&gt;1)? 1 : ((value&lt;0)? 0 : value); &#125; &#125; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Creates an instance of a HSL structure. /// &lt;/summary&gt; /// &lt;param name=\"h\"&gt;Hue value.&lt;/param&gt; /// &lt;param name=\"s\"&gt;Saturation value.&lt;/param&gt; /// &lt;param name=\"l\"&gt;Lightness value.&lt;/param&gt; public HSL(double h, double s, double l) &#123; this.hue = (h&gt;360)? 360 : ((h&lt;0)?0:h); this.saturation = (s&gt;1)? 1 : ((s&lt;0)?0:s); this.luminance = (l&gt;1)? 1 : ((l&lt;0)?0:l); &#125; public override bool Equals(Object obj) &#123; if(obj==null || GetType()!=obj.GetType()) return false; return (this == (HSL)obj); &#125; public override int GetHashCode() &#123; return Hue.GetHashCode() ^ Saturation.GetHashCode() ^ Luminance.GetHashCode(); &#125;&#125; CMYK color space The CMYK color space, also known as CMJN, stands for: Cyan. Ranges from 0 to 100% in most applications. Magenta. Ranges from 0 to 100% in most applications. Yellow. Ranges from 0 to 100% in most applications. blacK. Ranges from 0 to 100% in most applications. It is a subtractive color model used in color printing.CMYK works on an optical illusion that is based on light absorption. The principle is to superimpose three images; one for cyan, one for magenta and one for yellow; which will reproduce colors. Its common graphic representation is the following image: Like the RGB color model, CMYK is a combination of primary colors (cyan, magenta, yellow and black). It is, probably, the only thing they have in common. CMYK suffers from a lack of color shades that causes holes in the color spectrum it can reproduce. That’s why there are often differencies when someone convert a color between CMYK to RGB. Why using this model? Why black is used? you can tell me… Well it’s only for practical purpose. Wikipedia said: To improve print quality and reduce moiré patterns, Text is typically printed in black and includes fine detail (such as serifs); so to reproduce text - using three inks would require an extremely precise alignment for each three components image. A combination of cyan, magenta, and yellow pigments don’t produce (or rarely) pure black. Mixing all three color inks together to make black can make the paper rather wet when not using dry toner, which is an issue in high speed printing where the paper must dry extremely rapidly to avoid marking the next sheet, and poor quality paper such as newsprint may break if it becomes too wet. Using a unit amount of black ink rather than three unit amounts of the process color inks can lead to significant cost savings (black ink is often cheaper). Let’s come back to our reality. A CMYK structure can be: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384858687888990919293949596979899100101102103104105106107108109110111112/// &lt;summary&gt;/// Structure to define CMYK./// &lt;/summary&gt;public struct CMYK&#123; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets an empty CMYK structure; /// &lt;/summary&gt; public readonly static CMYK Empty = new CMYK(); private double c; private double m; private double y; private double k; public static bool operator ==(CMYK item1, CMYK item2) &#123; return ( item1.Cyan == item2.Cyan &amp;&amp; item1.Magenta == item2.Magenta &amp;&amp; item1.Yellow == item2.Yellow &amp;&amp; item1.Black == item2.Black ); &#125; public static bool operator !=(CMYK item1, CMYK item2) &#123; return ( item1.Cyan != item2.Cyan || item1.Magenta != item2.Magenta || item1.Yellow != item2.Yellow || item1.Black != item2.Black ); &#125; public double Cyan &#123; get &#123; return c; &#125; set &#123; c = value; c = (c&gt;1)? 1 : ((c&lt;0)? 0 : c); &#125; &#125; public double Magenta &#123; get &#123; return m; &#125; set &#123; m = value; m = (m&gt;1)? 1 : ((m&lt;0)? 0 : m); &#125; &#125; public double Yellow &#123; get &#123; return y; &#125; set &#123; y = value; y = (y&gt;1)? 1 : ((y&lt;0)? 0 : y); &#125; &#125; public double Black &#123; get &#123; return k; &#125; set &#123; k = value; k = (k&gt;1)? 1 : ((k&lt;0)? 0 : k); &#125; &#125; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Creates an instance of a CMYK structure. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public CMYK(double c, double m, double y, double k) &#123; this.c = c; this.m = m; this.y = y; this.k = k; &#125; public override bool Equals(Object obj) &#123; if(obj==null || GetType()!=obj.GetType()) return false; return (this == (CMYK)obj); &#125; public override int GetHashCode() &#123; return Cyan.GetHashCode() ^ Magenta.GetHashCode() ^ Yellow.GetHashCode() ^ Black.GetHashCode(); &#125;&#125; YUV color space The YUV model defines a color space in terms of one luma and two chrominance components. The YUV color model is used in the PAL, NTSC, and SECAM composite color video standards. YUV models human perception of color more closely than the standard RGB model used in computer graphics hardware. The YUV color space stands for: Y, the luma component, or the brightness. Ranges from 0 to 100% in most applications. U and V are the chrominance components (blue-luminance and red-luminance differences components). Expressed as factors depending on the YUV version you want to use. A graphic representation is the following image: A YUV structure can be: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758596061626364656667686970717273747576777879808182838485868788899091929394/// &lt;summary&gt;/// Structure to define YUV./// &lt;/summary&gt;public struct YUV&#123; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets an empty YUV structure. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public static readonly YUV Empty = new YUV(); private double y; private double u; private double v; public static bool operator ==(YUV item1, YUV item2) &#123; return ( item1.Y == item2.Y &amp;&amp; item1.U == item2.U &amp;&amp; item1.V == item2.V ); &#125; public static bool operator !=(YUV item1, YUV item2) &#123; return ( item1.Y != item2.Y || item1.U != item2.U || item1.V != item2.V ); &#125; public double Y &#123; get &#123; return y; &#125; set &#123; y = value; y = (y&gt;1)? 1 : ((y&lt;0)? 0 : y); &#125; &#125; public double U &#123; get &#123; return u; &#125; set &#123; u = value; u = (u&gt;0.436)? 0.436 : ((u&lt;-0.436)? -0.436 : u); &#125; &#125; public double V &#123; get &#123; return v; &#125; set &#123; v = value; v = (v&gt;0.615)? 0.615 : ((v&lt;-0.615)? -0.615 : v); &#125; &#125; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Creates an instance of a YUV structure. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public YUV(double y, double u, double v) &#123; this.y = (y&gt;1)? 1 : ((y&lt;0)? 0 : y); this.u = (u&gt;0.436)? 0.436 : ((u&lt;-0.436)? -0.436 : u); this.v = (v&gt;0.615)? 0.615 : ((v&lt;-0.615)? -0.615 : v); &#125; public override bool Equals(Object obj) &#123; if(obj==null || GetType()!=obj.GetType()) return false; return (this == (YUV)obj); &#125; public override int GetHashCode() &#123; return Y.GetHashCode() ^ U.GetHashCode() ^ V.GetHashCode(); &#125;&#125; CIE XYZ color space In opposition to the previous models, the CIE XYZ model defines an absolute color space. It is also known as the CIE 1931 XYZ color space and stands for: X, which can be compared to red Ranges from 0 to 0.9505 Y, which can be compared to green Ranges from 0 to 1.0 Z, which can be compared to blue Ranges from 0 to 1.089 Before trying to explain why I include this color space in this article, you have to know that it’s one of the first standards created by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) in 1931. It is based on direct measurements of the human eye, and serves as the basis from which many other color spaces are defined. A graphic representation is the following image: A CIE XYZ structure can be: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384858687888990919293949596979899100101102/// &lt;summary&gt;/// Structure to define CIE XYZ./// &lt;/summary&gt;public struct CIEXYZ&#123; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets an empty CIEXYZ structure. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public static readonly CIEXYZ Empty = new CIEXYZ(); /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets the CIE D65 (white) structure. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public static readonly CIEXYZ D65 = new CIEXYZ(0.9505, 1.0, 1.0890); private double x; private double y; private double z; public static bool operator ==(CIEXYZ item1, CIEXYZ item2) &#123; return ( item1.X == item2.X &amp;&amp; item1.Y == item2.Y &amp;&amp; item1.Z == item2.Z ); &#125; public static bool operator !=(CIEXYZ item1, CIEXYZ item2) &#123; return ( item1.X != item2.X || item1.Y != item2.Y || item1.Z != item2.Z ); &#125; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets or sets X component. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public double X &#123; get &#123; return this.x; &#125; set &#123; this.x = (value&gt;0.9505)? 0.9505 : ((value&lt;0)? 0 : value); &#125; &#125; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets or sets Y component. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public double Y &#123; get &#123; return this.y; &#125; set &#123; this.y = (value&gt;1.0)? 1.0 : ((value&lt;0)?0 : value); &#125; &#125; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Gets or sets Z component. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public double Z &#123; get &#123; return this.z; &#125; set &#123; this.z = (value&gt;1.089)? 1.089 : ((value&lt;0)? 0 : value); &#125; &#125; public CIEXYZ(double x, double y, double z) &#123; this.x = (x&gt;0.9505)? 0.9505 : ((x&lt;0)? 0 : x); this.y = (y&gt;1.0)? 1.0 : ((y&lt;0)? 0 : y); this.z = (z&gt;1.089)? 1.089 : ((z&lt;0)? 0 : z); &#125; public override bool Equals(Object obj) &#123; if(obj==null || GetType()!=obj.GetType()) return false; return (this == (CIEXYZ)obj); &#125; public override int GetHashCode() &#123; return X.GetHashCode() ^ Y.GetHashCode() ^ Z.GetHashCode(); &#125;&#125; Well! why do I have to include this model? I have made a quick research to include Cie L*ab color model in this article, and I find that a conversion to an absolute color space is required before converting to L*ab. The model used in the conversion principle is Cie XYZ. So, I’ve included it and now everyone can understand “what are those XYZ values” used further in the article. CIE Lab color space A Lab color space is a color-opponent space with dimension L for luminance and a and b for the color-opponent dimensions, based on nonlinearly-compressed CIE XYZ color space coordinates.&quot; As said in the previous definition, CIE Lab color space, also know as CIE 1976 color space, stands for: L*, the luminance a*, the red/green color-opponent dimension b* , the yellow/blue color-opponent dimension The Lab color model has been created to serve as a device independent model to be used as a reference. It is based directly on the CIE 1931 XYZ color space as an attempt to linearize the perceptibility of color differences. The non-linear relations for L*, a*, and b* are intended to mimic the logarithmic response of the eye, coloring information is referred to the color of the white point of the system.

I still don’t intend to create a “color framework”(so do I), but if you have other ideas… Conversion between models A - RGB Conversions Converting RGB color to any other model is the basis in conversion algorithms. It implies a normalisation of red, green and blue : value ranges now from [0…255] to [0…1]. a - RGB to HSB The conversion principle is the one below: H ? [0, 360] S, V, R, G, B ? [0, 1] V = MAX Well!

It’s the .NET solution for keeping the same rounding behavior. If you don’t understand what I mean, try the sample code below: 12Console.WriteLine(Math.Round(4.45, 1)); // returns 4.4.Console.WriteLine(Math.Round(4.55, 1)); // returns 4.6. You didn’t notice a problem? Ok, rouding 4.45 should have returned 4.5 and not 4.4. The solution is using String.Format() which always applies “round-to-even” method. c - RGB to CMYK The conversion principle is the one below : R, G, B ?

Something I can explain. As you probably already know, web colors can be defined in two ways: for example, “red” can be defined as rgb(255,0,0) or #FF0000. The explanation of the second form is simple : “#” character tells that the format is the hexadecimal one. The last 6 characters define 3 pairs: one for “Red”, one for “Green” and one for “Blue”. Each pair is a hexadecimal value (base 16) of a value which ranges from 0 to 255. So, you can divide each color component by 16 and replace numbers superior to 9 by theirs hexadecimal value (eg. 10 = A, 11 = B, etc.)… but the best way is to use String.Format() habilities. 12345678910/// &lt;summary&gt;/// Converts a RGB color format to an hexadecimal color./// &lt;/summary&gt;/// &lt;param name=\"r\"&gt;Red value.&lt;/param&gt;/// &lt;param name=\"g\"&gt;Green value.&lt;/param&gt;/// &lt;param name=\"b\"&gt;Blue value.&lt;/param&gt;public static string RGBToHex(int r, int g, int b)&#123; return String.Format(\"#&#123;0:x2&#125;&#123;1:x2&#125;&#123;2:x2&#125;\", r, g, b).ToUpper();&#125; f - RGB to XYZ The conversion principle is the one below: R, G, B ?

This report will discuss several problems from 1935 to 1936 in respect to the following subject: Exploitation from Labor Union Problems, Exploitation from Wage Problems, Overtime Working Problems and Labor Strike Problems. This report will first discuss the background of the exploitation of the workers in textile industry. Background In the age of the republics, textile industry is the major part of the industry in China although the whole country is in wars. According to China Labor Problem, At the time, although the country suffered in wars and smokes while the business of cotton industry worldwide is distressing, the textile industry in China is bucking the trend[1]. It is reported in Labor Economy that in Republic 22, the amount of spindles raises to 2,637,413 from 2,383,474 in Republic 20 while 7 more cotton mills are built in two years.[2]Compared to Republic 21, In Republic 22, textile industry has gain 172,109 spindles, 22,522 more twiner and 1,252 more Denim.[3] All the data showed that the textile industry have an abnormal trend compared to other places. However, this leads to the problem of probably exploitation of workers in the industry, especially when it is also the time of Second Sino-Japanese War at the time, which started in 1937[4]. Also, in a bigger image, according to Resources of Legitimacy and Chinese Workers’ Activism, Since the end of the 1937(from October to December), the Chinese workers are starting to be aggressive and active which is the direct cause of the Shanghai Workers’ Strike(上海工潮) in 1937. Exploitation can also be a major point that cause labor workers, especially male workers, to strike[5]. All of these question leads a possible exploitation on male worker in Textile industry, however, further investigation is needed to give a larger image in the year of 1936. Labor Union The labor union is one of the problem that caused exploitation. Since Republic 12, when the first official Labor Union, Shanghai Federation of Labor Union(上海工團聯合會), The members initially aimed to improve the life conditions as well as treatments to labor by changing constitution. However, after May Thirtieth Movement(五卅運動), People are more belligerent and quit labor unions[6]. Since the Age of Dec 8th(一二八時代), Chinese cotton mills are monopolized by Japan enterprises, which leads to the layoffs in local-opened cotton mills under the situation of the depressed market and lack of resource. This situation further leads to the resistance of the Labor Union. Meanwhile, Japan-based cotton mills push harsher policies, this include over-working, wage cut-down, more penalty and no leisure activities. This leads to common clashes in the early 1936. The clash in Da Kang Spinner(大康紗場) indirectly leads to the one of the main labor strikes started and sponsored by several groups including two labor union called Fu Li Hui(福利會) which belongs to Shanghai Federation of Labor Union, and Zhong Yi Hui(忠義會) which belongs to Bureau of Social Affairs(社會局). Nonetheless, since the exploitation is pressed on workers, especially the male workers who start the strike, the Main Labor Union of Cotton Textile Industry cannot be established until the first large labor strike, even though most of the workers are even not the member of the union. Furthermore, this leads to the ending of the Main Labor Union of Cotton Textile Industry as most of the male workers are fired and replaced by female and child workers.[7] On contrary, the workers in silk industry shows strong ambition Since 1934, as the Main Labor Union of Silk Industry first established in 1934 with the huge labor strike, which cause the high pressure in the industry in the next 2 years without labor union, until the cotton textile industry workers’ strike. The Main Labor Union of Silk Industry is established again in the middle of 1936, which start another huge strike in 1937.[8] The labor unions are the one key to stop exploitation of the workers, however, with what I find, it can be clearly shown that the workers, especially male workers, are exploited by factories by starting the unofficial labor union. Wage Wage is also one angle that showed the exploitation of the male workers in textile industry in 1936. According to a research in 1937, in textile industry, the male workers have generally a lower wage. The average maximum wage of male worker (except for the head) in Japan-based cotton mills is exactly 0.48 Yuan while female workers enjoys 0.77 Yuan of maximum wage, which is almost double. The average minimum wage of male worker (except for the head) is 0.77 Yuan. Let us look at an example of Tong Xing Cotton Mill(同興紗廠). The detail[9] of their wage can be shown in the partially retrieved table below: Section Job Title Max Wage Min Wage Shi fang bu(始紡部) Male Worker 0.48 Yuan 0.40 Yuan Shi fang bu(始紡部) Female Worker 0.70 Yuan 0.50 Yuan Chu fang bu(粗紡部) Male Worker 0.48 Yuan 0.40 Yuan Chu fang bu(粗紡部) Female Worker 0.70 Yuan 0.50 Yuan Jing fang bu(精紡部) Male Worker 0.51 Yuan 0.40 Yuan Jing fang bu(精紡部) Head of Male Worker 0.82 Yuan Jing fang bu(精紡部) Jie tou Female Worker(接頭女工) 0.78 Yuan 0.50 Yuan Jing fang bu(精紡部) Luo sha Female Worker(落紗女工) 0.80 Yuan 0.75 Yuan Jing fang bu(精紡部) Yao che tou(搖車頭) 0.95 Yuan 0.90 Yuan Yao sha bu(搖紗部) Male Worker 0.48 Yuan 0.40 Yuan Yao sha bu(搖紗部) Female Worker 0.70 Yuan 0.50 Yuan It can be clearly shown that male have a lower wage compare to the female workers. Although England-based cotton mills have an average higher wage compared to Japan-based mills, a difference in wage of male and female can be still clearly shown. Take the largest mill among all England-based mills, Yi He Cotton Mill(怡和紗廠)[10] as an example: Section Workshop Worker Gender Daily Max Wage Daily Min Wage Daily Head Wage Roving Section Gang si che(鋼絲車) Old Female 0.6 Yuan 0.9 Yuan Roving Section Gang si che(鋼絲車) Old Male 0.5 Yuan 0.9 Yuan Roving Section Gang si che(鋼絲車) New Female 0.6 Yuan 0.9 Yuan Roving Section Gang si che(鋼絲車) New Male 0.5 Yuan 0.9 Yuan Roving Section Tiao zi che(條子車) Old Female 0.60 Yuan 0.42 Yuan 0.9 Yuan Roving Section Tiao zi che(條子車) Old Male 0.85 Yuan 0.65 Yuan Roving Section Tiao zi che(條子車) New Female 0.60 Yuan 0.42 Yuan 0.9 Yuan Roving Section Tiao zi che(條子車) New Male 0.85 Yuan 0.65 Yuan It also shows the same trend as Tong Xin Cotton Mill. This clearly indicated the fact of mistreatment to the male, probably due to the aggressiveness and independence that shown from the characteristics from the male workers, which is hard to made them to be obedient, comparing to male workers, the female workers are more obedient, which, in consequence, they are stable and more ‘trustable’ that they receive a relatively higher wage compare to the female workers.[11] Hence, male workers are also exploited in the area of the wage. Overtime Working It also shows the problem of the exploitation of workers, but it is not that obvious compared to other factors. There are generally three types of the workers in the textile industry: full-time workers(日夜工), all-day workers(長日工), and all-night workers(長夜工)[12]. Full-time workers are most exploited on over-time working. Comparing with Europe and America, China Industries, especially textile industry, have longer work time, which is 12 hours per day, while in the west, the work time is usually 8 hours per day. Over-time working is common among the workers that time, especially during labor strike (which will discuss in the next section), the workers have to work over-time (mostly male workers). This is because they hope to prevent the worker to think about strike back.[13] Other two kind, all-day workers(長日工) and all-night workers(長夜工), are not usually the target of over-working, since only a few factories have the job. This includes Yi He Cotton Mill(怡和紗廠) and several other smaller factories. Full-day workers may have to work up to 7 more hours per day when over-working, according to the resource. However, as the information they gathered is not fully complete, the little information can be provided. However, the overall image showed the exploitation of the male worker although it is not very strong. Labor Strike The problem of labor strike is pretty common since 1936 is the beginning of the Shanghai Worker’s Strike[14]. Since the early years, warlord is pretty common around China, which cause the pressure on workers at the time, with the exploitation of male workers, the feeling of anger began to spread around the city. This directly leads to labor strikes in 1920s and 1930s.[15] In the major labor strike in 1930s, such as the huge labor strikes of silk industry in 1934 and largest labor strike in Shanghai started by Japan-based cotton mills in 1936[16]. The labor strikes are usually not well organized, since there is bad communication between labors in different factories. This leads to a direct failure of the two strike. [17] Besides these two main strikes, the major reason for labor strike in 1936 is the Case of Da Kang Spinner. In February 6th, 1936, 8000 workers, mainly male workers, start the labor strike since they are angry that the factory leads killed one of their colleague Mei Shijun(梅世鈞), which caused the punishment to the workers who joined labor strike.7 day later, another spinner Xi He(喜和紗廠) had a labor strike since worker are not satisfied with the layoff.[18] These cases are common in the early 1936, which are still not effective. With the recovery of the silk and cotton business, it finally leads to the huge strike of Shanghai textile workers in Japan-based factories in the late 1936. It even inspired the textile workers in Tsing Tao(青島) to strike. In Shanghai, totally of 11,974 textile workers from 220 factories joined this strike. This showed how actually the tension is to the workers that time. According to the records, about 80 percent of the people are male.[19] All these problems showed that the male are usually the one who stand up. Usually, factory do not like this kind of people such that they are the one being exploited. Overall, the exploitation of male worker does exist in the perspective of labor strike. Conclusion To sum up, Exploitation from labor union problems, wage problems, overtime working problems and labor strike problems do exist, but, some of the do not seem very exploited to male workers but more for female and child workers. On the other side, since male worker is usually the major force against the factory leaders, they are usually exploited as over-activeness in the labor strike and labor union. The exploitation of male workers in textile industry from 1936 to 1937 in Shanghai do exist, and people do not overlook them.

This article illustrates the danger of beauty with two main reasons of extreme means to keep beautiful and following blindly to the fashion of Ideal Thin. The most significant danger of Ideal Thin is that people take extreme trials, like taking slimming drugs and extreme dieting, to achieve the perfect beautiful shape that may not be achievable. One most common way is to take those weight-loss supplements that usually claimed “Guaranteed losing 10 kg in 2month”, yet it is reported that these supplements have strong side-effects on people from arrhythmia, valvular heart disease to serious eye problems or even congestive heart failure (Theobald, 2016). Some people think people are just not unintelligent, and they should know the proper means to be slim, such as exercising regularly and eating healthily and wisely. However, there are still numerous people would take risk to do this “fast and simple” way to become slim instead of using “slow and painful” ways like exercising. According to a report in 2015, one forth Americans admits that they use ways like weight-lost supplements to lose weight (WABC, 2015). This clearly shows countless people just want to become slim effortlessly, taking a pill every day without going to gym. What’s more, people could be harmed by this trend because of herd mentality. When people see the trend of Ideal Thin continuing growing as the media promoting it and people doing it, People can hardly prevent the arose of the ambition for Ideal Thin. According to a report from three researchers (Groesz, Levine, Murnen, 2001), People can get upset about their own body shape under the influence of other people and the promotion form the advertisement, which cause them decide to join the people who have a strong desire to be Ideal Thin. Nonetheless, people claim that they are smart. They believe that educated people will not be influenced, so not all the people will be following blindly. It is true, smart people do know these image is impossible, according to the research done by Dr. Engeln (2013), a psychologist and body image researcher at Northwestern University. But she also discovered that some educated people, although knowing the image is harmful and impossible, some of them said they think they would want to have a try. As you can see, the herd mentality is still beyond people’s logic which is not the public would love to see. The dangerous trend drive more and more people into this endless hole, and people scramble for it endlessly. What we know is that this trend could be unstoppable, but the society is continuing donating effort to slow down this fashion. Nobody knows what will the trend be someday, but this fashion will gradually be changed and stop harming people. References Groesz, L., Levine, M., Murnen, S. (2001).

And you know, sometimes the worst nightmare isn’t at night, and your best experience isn’t at day. In the night of the second day, we were impatiently waiting for hiking. No need to prepare for dinner? Perfect. I picked up the schedule reading, thinking. But this perfect dream soon broke by the operator’s announcement: “Now, you will approach to hike. But, you need to hike to fight for your dinner. Good luck!” what a shock. We need to hike to fight for the food? “We need strategies in order to hike perfectly.” Someone in our team said. We immediately agreed with his idea with no doubt. However, we soon had disagreements about the routine. Our ideas are too diverged that we are the last one to go. Everything went fine at first. We got our food directly and fast, which gave us a lot of confidence. But soon we had a trust problem with each other. We couldn’t find the position of the check point, so we stopped a few times checking whether the position is right or not. Although we did check, we still missed the check point. What’s even worse, we walked two extra kilometers- which means we wasted a lot of time on seeking the check point. We finally give up looking for more food and went back, although it was already very dark. Surprisingly, we actually found our dinner very delicious. I felt strange, since I didn’t think this make any sense. But then I realized that because we still get something more than a dinner. When we wondering whether it is right or not, we should be brave enough to rise objection instead of muting yourself and following what others doing. This camp let me learn so much about myself as well as how to behave in a team. As we walked through the mountains, I feel really lucky to join this camp. This camp really opens my eyes. These mountains, with all the great memories, will all be rooted deeply into my mind. Hope one day, I can climb up the peak of the my mountains-life.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"REDBird","slug":"REDBird","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/REDBird/"},{"name":"Write-ups","slug":"Write-ups","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Write-ups/"}]},{"title":"How to judge whether a webpage existed in a fast way","slug":"csharp-judge-whether-webpage-exists","date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/03/09/csharp-judge-whether-webpage-exists/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2016/03/09/csharp-judge-whether-webpage-exists/","excerpt":"","text":"Recently I am coding a app for viewing newspaper.

We are so into it that we forgot everything, although there are NGO providing free services. Now I realised it. Although NGO might try really hard, the resources still cannot help them, because they just cannot find and do not have enough time to even look for help. I feel so lucky. because we are so lucky to be born in better cities, and receive better educations. They are at the crossroad. Every step they step out is gambling.

The following article will look into the reasons of its success, the condition under its success and the lasting impact of the laptop. The beneficial of portability to the businessmen and students is the reason of the success of laptop. The portability of laptop changed how people work. People used to need to get two desktop computers to work at both the office and in home. It can be very difficult to transfer files. Microsoft even invented Briefcase for painlessly synchronize data between computers. (Microsoft, 2007) But with the laptop, you can work at anywhere at any time. It saves a lot of budgets, which made businessman fall in love with laptop. Just in 2001, it is said that about 21 percent of business traveler used laptop when staying in airport. (Ramirez, 2001). Besides businessmen, students are another group of people who benefits from laptops. Students can access and modify their homework easily, while learning the essential computer skills and other educational skills like mathematics and language skills on these portable devices. (Battro, 2010) The education will not be so easy and convenient without laptops. It transforms the ways teachers educate students. And, the need of portability and the grown of the Internet leads the laptops to success. In the early stage of laptops, experts and business want to be able to bring their data around, which is the reason why the first mass-produced laptop is manufactured. (Felsenstein, 2009). As the time goes by, as the world are connected more closely, People need to process a lot of documents in a shorter time. With new ways of the internet connection Wi-Fi, the popularity of laptops are growing vigorously in America, the laptop use in adult took over the desktop computer with 2 percent more as there are more and more people start using internet with around 80 percent of people. (Relatively Interesting, 2012) The impact of laptops are huge and time-lapsing. With the help of the laptop, new technology of network connection such as Bluetooth and wireless hotspot are widely used. (Relatively Interesting, 2012) At the same time, more and more computer users choose to get a laptop than a desktop computer. (Pew Research Center, 2015) Also, the laptop are so widely used that it evolved into a lot other forms to match people’s want. For example, netbook, invented by Intel, is a new form of laptops which is intended to provide public with simple internet access. (K@W Global Focus, 2008). What’s more important, it is continuing evolving until now. The newest form of laptops is laplet, also called 2-in-1 laptop, from Surface Series by Microsoft to iPad Pro by Apple, starting to occupy the market. (Peckham, 2015) The laptop will continue evolving, benefiting people’s lives. Although tablet seems to have a more and more important role in the computer family, and desktop computer is still essential for heavy work, the laptop can finally be in a form of combining all benefits of tablets and all great features of desktop computers, to be a real portable ultimate utility to help people get done real work. (Eadicicco, 2013) The future of the laptops will be bright and it will be rooted deeper in our daily lives. It will be on more people’s lap. References Battro, A. M. (2010, July 15).

It is a really beautiful city with beautiful rivers, fresh air, clean water and extraordinary mountains-but I rather call them peculiar stones, because they are purely amazing. I have never seen such beautiful mountain before, they looked really strange and awesome. The cruise ship trip on the Li River has the best scenery among all. That day in the morning, we packed up all our stuffs in our bags. We then went on a cruise ship to Yangshuo through Li River. After the ship started moving, I just couldn’t wait and went to the deck. We really like the scenery around. Since this is not a travel season in Guilin, there are not so many ships on the Li River, which help us a lot. It’s just after a few days’ raining, and it added an extra layer of mysterious. The icy-cold wind is blowing hard on the deck, but I don’t care. All around me are sights. Sights that are already known around the world. There are all kinds of weird mountains around-although I prefer the expression of peculiar stones to describe it. All of these mountains gave me a feeling of the wallpapers from OS X- but more Chinese Style. They just like Chinese ink brush painting- they are looking incredibly good. My father love it so much that when we were called to eat our launch, he didn’t want to. We then see two major sights that we all want to see The Reflection of yellow cloth as well as the Nine Horse Mountain. It is said that only genius people can count all 9 horse out on Nine Horse Mountain. I tried my best, but I only count 7 horse out after all. In the rest of the ship trip, I am too cold to go out, so I stayed in the ship although the sights outside are still impressive. There are so many sights to see and place to explore in Guilin. These unforgettable experience can only be experienced by trying out yourself. I believe you will love it.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Write-ups","slug":"Write-ups","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Write-ups/"}]},{"title":"The Walk·行","slug":"the-walk","date":"2015-12-28T15:56:39.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","comments":true,"path":"2015/12/28/the-walk/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2015/12/28/the-walk/","excerpt":"There is nothing more precious than new experiences.

This 3-day camping experience have really blew my mind and change how I really see act as an individual and as a team. With the failures and success, pains and happiness within, I harvest this best experience ever. Imagining walking alone, in a dark deep forest, slowly. It is already frightening when you hear it. That was the first night, and we were asked to walk alone in the dark deep forest, to give space to us to think about our future. We are asked to walk one by one with the gap of 3 minutes, to make sure that we are all walking solely. All of us had to wait patiently until it’s our turn. Soon, I could not wait and cut in the line to go first. At first, everything was fine for me. I felt quite comfortable at first, while the wind was blowing smoothly. I felt comfortable and walked in a normal speed, to think about my future. When I just decided that I will complete all of the apps that I have delayed in this academic year, I suddenly got a feeling of scare. I don’t know where it comes from, I was just simply scared. I left my torch on and started to run in this dark forest. I made it eventually. But this one really teach me that actually, the scare can cause hallucination. Sometimes, in our life, there are always challenges like these hallucinations that can scares you, but if we don’t be afraid of it, we can eventually achieve what we really want. This activity, is totally different from other activity in the camp. I teach me one very important thing: we are born with fear. Sometimes, this sudden fear can interfere us with no reason. So this is why we should work hard. although they are characteristics that born with us, we cannot live without them. So, What we do is the same. When we meet difficulties, we have to conquer them instead of ignore them. This is what called life.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"REDBird","slug":"REDBird","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/REDBird/"},{"name":"Write-ups","slug":"Write-ups","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Write-ups/"}]},{"title":"Usage Of the new Segoe MDL2 icons","slug":"uwp-usage-of-the-new-segoe-mdl2-icons","date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","comments":true,"path":"2015/11/27/uwp-usage-of-the-new-segoe-mdl2-icons/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2015/11/27/uwp-usage-of-the-new-segoe-mdl2-icons/","excerpt":"The Windows 8/8.1 Segoe UI Symbol icon font has been replaced with the Segoe MDL2 Assets font effective with the release of Windows 10.

So in Windows 10, You have to use the new Segoe MDL2. Besides the traditional use, There is other more simple way of using them. Font direct is a way I find that can be useful. I found this way by using the IntensiveTemplate to build my app uwp.HKUST. They use the direct font: Then it will be very hard to input the font. I have tried to find a good website to find the way to input the font since the system itself don’t support the extended Segoe UI Symbol series. I find a great website to transfer the code: Unicode Converter . This is a great website to type the untypeable code.

8的LongListSelector控件按拼音分组主要有两种方法，一个是在数据源里手工指定拼音首字母字段，作为index，这种方法效率高但会造成数据冗余不宜维护。另一个就是我今天介绍的方法，来自MSDN，虽然官网例子是针对是英文数据的首字母分组，但其实稍微改一下还是是支持中文的。 实现方法很简单。首先你需要一个来自MSDN的AlphaKeyGroup类，代码如下： 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859606162636465public class AlphaKeyGroup&lt;T&gt; : List&lt;T&gt;&#123; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// The delegate that is used to get the key information. /// &lt;/summary&gt; /// &lt;param name=\"item\"&gt;An object of type T&lt;/param&gt; /// &lt;returns&gt;The key value to use for this object&lt;/returns&gt; public delegate string GetKeyDelegate(T item); /// &lt;summary&gt; /// The Key of this group. /// &lt;/summary&gt; public string Key &#123; get; private set; &#125; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Public constructor. /// &lt;/summary&gt; /// &lt;param name=\"key\"&gt;The key for this group.&lt;/param&gt; public AlphaKeyGroup(string key) &#123; Key = key; &#125; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Create a list of AlphaGroup&lt;T&gt; with keys set by a SortedLocaleGrouping. /// &lt;/summary&gt; /// &lt;param name=\"slg\"&gt;The &lt;/param&gt; /// &lt;returns&gt;Theitems source for a LongListSelector&lt;/returns&gt; private static List&lt;AlphaKeyGroup&lt;T&gt;&gt; CreateGroups(SortedLocaleGrouping slg) &#123; return slg.GroupDisplayNames.Select(key =&gt; new AlphaKeyGroup&lt;T&gt;(key)).ToList(); &#125; /// &lt;summary&gt; /// Create a list of AlphaGroup&lt;T&gt; with keys set by a SortedLocaleGrouping. /// &lt;/summary&gt; /// &lt;param name=\"items\"&gt;The items to place in the groups.&lt;/param&gt; /// &lt;param name=\"ci\"&gt;The CultureInfo to group and sort by.&lt;/param&gt; /// &lt;param name=\"getKey\"&gt;A delegate to get the key from an item.&lt;/param&gt; /// &lt;param name=\"sort\"&gt;Will sort the data if true.&lt;/param&gt; /// &lt;returns&gt;An items source for a LongListSelector&lt;/returns&gt; public static List&lt;AlphaKeyGroup&lt;T&gt;&gt; CreateGroups(IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; items, CultureInfo ci, GetKeyDelegate getKey, bool sort) &#123; var slg = new SortedLocaleGrouping(ci); var list = CreateGroups(slg); foreach (var item in items) &#123; var index = 0; if (slg.SupportsPhonetics) &#123; //check if your database has yomi string for item //if it does not, then do you want to generate Yomi or ask the user for this item. //index = slg.GetGroupIndex(getKey(Yomiof(item))); &#125; else &#123; index = slg.GetGroupIndex(getKey(item)); &#125; if (index &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; index &lt; list.Count) &#123; list[index].Add(item); &#125; &#125; if (!sort) return list; foreach (var group in list) &#123; @group.Sort((c0, c1) =&gt; ci.CompareInfo.Compare(getKey(c0), getKey(c1))); &#125; return list; &#125;&#125; 这个类里面主要的精髓就在于： 1var slg = new SortedLocaleGrouping(ci); SortedLocaleGrouping可以根据传入的传入的CultureInfo返回经过排序的组标头。 要按照拼音首字母排序，我们只要传入中国大陆的CultureInfo就可以了，也就是zh-CN。在中文环境的Windows Phone系统上，当然也可以用当前UI线程的CultureInfo去获得 System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture 但是为了保证我们的拼音排序能在任何语言设置下都统一，我还是建议写死zh-CN在里面。 在我的应用里，我需要按地铁站点(Station类)的地铁站名首字母(Station.StationName)分组，所以我绑定的集合要用AlphaKeyGroup包一下： 1public ObservableCollection&lt;AlphaKeyGroup&lt;Station&gt;&gt; GroupedStations &#123; ... &#125; 然后，在给这个集合赋值的地方写Group的具体逻辑： 12345GroupedStations = AlphaKeyGroup&lt;Station&gt;.CreateGroups( AllStations, new CultureInfo(\"zh-CN\"), s =&gt; s.StationName.Substring(0, 1), true).ToObservableCollection(); 第一个参数AllStations是原始数据，一个普通的IEnumerable集合。 第二个参数是最重要的，按哪种Culture进行分组，一定要传入zh-CN，简体中文。 第三个参数是个lambda表达式，这个委托负责分组字段的具体逻辑，在这里我们要按Station.StationName的第一个字的拼音首字母排序，所以需要取Substring(0,1)，返回Station.StationName的第一个字，之后SortedLocaleGrouping就可以自动进行拼音首字母分组了。 第四个参数表示经过分组的排序结果需不需要排序，true表示需要排序，这也是我们通常的需求。 至此，后端代码的工作就全部搞定了。前台xaml上的数据绑定还是和普通的LongListSelector没啥区别。 XAML: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526&lt;phone:LongListSelector

做法很简单，和ASP.NET网站在Global.asax中使用的全局错误处理类似，WP应用也有个全局错误处理的事件。 打开App.xaml.cs，定位到Application_UnhandledException(object sender, ApplicationUnhandledExceptionEventArgs e)事件处理函数上。 当任何未处理的异常产生时，这个函数都会被call到。我们的任务是发送邮件给应用作者（通常就是你自己），所以我们可以把项目模板中默认的代码给去掉，删除这些代码： 1234567if (Debugger.IsAttached)&#123; // An unhandled exception has occurred; break into the debugger Debugger.Break();&#125; 然后换成我们自己代码： 1234567891011121314151617181920var result = MessageBox.Show(\"程序不小心爆掉了。点击确定发送错误详情给软件作者以帮助改进软件。\", \"注定孤独一生\",MessageBoxButton.OKCancel);if (result == MessageBoxResult.OK)&#123; var msg = e.ExceptionObject.Message; while(null != e.ExceptionObject.InnerException) &#123; e.ExceptionObject = e.ExceptionObject.InnerException; msg += (e.ExceptionObject.Message + Environment.NewLine);&#125; var emailComposeTask = new EmailComposeTask &#123; Subject = string.Format(\"《你的应用名称》应用异常报告\"), Body = \"Message: \" + msg, To =\"你的Email地址\" &#125;; emailComposeTask.Show();&#125;e.Handled = true; 代码比较直接，首先，用MessageBox给用户弹了个框，让用户自己选择是否发送错误报告。如果用户选择了“确定”，就开始收集异常详情。ApplicationUnhandledExceptionEventArgs这个参数的ExceptionObject类型就是System.Exception，所以获取最上层的异常消息做法就像平时try…catch里通常写的ex.Message类似，可以通过Exception对象Message属性获得 e.ExceptionObject.Message。 然而，异常并不通常只有一层，有时候我们会遇到exception里还包着一个innerexception的情况，并且我们不知道是不是包了两层就结束了，有可能innerexception里还有innerexception，所以就得写个循环来遍历直到最底层的innerexception，于是就有了这段代码： 123456while(null != e.ExceptionObject.InnerException)&#123; e.ExceptionObject = e.ExceptionObject.InnerException; msg += (e.ExceptionObject.Message + Environment.NewLine);&#125; 其中，“Environment.NewLine”的意思是换行，目的是提高邮件的可阅读性。 收集完异常信息后，我们要调用WP系统提供的发送邮件的task来发送异常报告。我们的应用调用系统任务，比如发邮件、打电话、发短信都是通过Task来完成的，email的用法在MSDN上可以找到：http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/windowsphone/develop/hh394003(v=vs.105).aspx 这个网页里你也能找到其他task的用法。 Subject是邮件的主题，Body是正文，To是收件人。当然，如果你需要，你还可以增加Bcc(密件抄送)和Cc(抄送)。

打开一个视频，这样，系统会自动关闭后台的音乐功能，也可以实现关闭音乐的功能(尝试了一下，很难通过代码来实现，操作麻烦) 通过异常让系统关闭后台音乐功能(下面用此方法关闭音乐) 首先要用到系统的媒体播放器。使用媒体播放器播放应用程序的音乐文件的时候，当程序关闭或墓碑化时，音乐会停止播放，只有媒体库中的音乐才能在后台播放 首先准备一个音乐文件(用来辅助关闭音乐功能，越小越好)，假设为00.mp3 用到的类：MediaPlayer 添加引用：Microsoft.Xna.Framework 首先是MediaPlayer的用法 由于在XNA中每33fp就会更新画面一次，所以在Silverlight Application中需要透过指定一个定期执行FrameworkDispatcher.Update()的事件。 12345678910111213 //设置定时器DispatcherTimer timer = new DispatcherTimer();timer.Interval = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(33); timer.Tick += delegate &#123; try &#123; FrameworkDispatcher.Update(); &#125; catch &#123; &#125; &#125;; timer.Start();//接下来通过Song创建音频对象 Song没有构造函数，通过静态函数FromUri创建 Song song = Song.FromUri(&quot;MySong&quot;, new Uri(&quot;00.mp3&quot;, UriKind.Relative)); 播放音乐 MediaPlayer.Play(song); MediaPlayer属性和方法(不支持快进/快退，不支持设置进度) IsMuted 静音设置 IsRepeating 重复播放 IsShuffled 随机播放 MoveNext/MovePrevious 下一曲/上一曲 Play/Stop 播放/停止 Pause/Resume 暂停/恢复 PlayPosition 进度(只读) State 状态 Song.FromUri创建Song对象的音频文件只能是资源文件，不能是独立存储中的文件。暂时没有API可以用 关闭音乐的思路： 把前面注册 FrameworkDispatcher.Update() 的事件去掉，这样在调用MediaPlayer播放器播放音乐的时候就会出现异常 通过两次调用，就可以关闭掉音乐服务，当然，程序也会关闭，可以写一个磁贴贴在Start界面上，关闭音乐后自动关闭程序

Windows Phone 的代码示例中找到这个已完成的示例。 设置磁贴计划 ShellTileSchedule 允许您设置将更新磁贴的背景图像的一次性计划或定期计划。即使您的应用程序处于非活动状态，该计划仍然可以继续运行。ShellTileSchedule 还可以用于停止为您的应用程序运行的任何计划。每当应用程序由于计划失败而启动时，应用程序都应该存储其 ShellTileSchedule 设置并启动该计划，即使应用程序不再运行，也可以取消计划。 ShellTileSchedule 示例是一个具有四个按钮的简单程序。这四个按钮分别是： 更新磁贴一次。 创建一个更新磁贴次数不确定的计划。 创建一个更新磁贴指定次数的计划。 停止正在运行的任何计划。 请记住，将应用程序的应用程序磁贴固定到“开始”屏幕以便测试磁贴更新功能。 创建应用程序 UI 在 Visual Studio 2010 Express for Windows Phone 中，通过选择**“文件 | 新建项目”**菜单命令创建一个新项目。 将显示“新建项目”窗口。展开 Visual C# 模板，然后选择**“Silverlight for Windows Phone”**模板。 选择**“Windows Phone 应用程序”**模板。用您选择的名称填写“名称”。 单击**“确定”**。将显示“新建 Windows Phone 应用程序”窗口。 在**“Windows Phone OS 目标版本”菜单中，确保“Windows Phone OS 7.1”**处于选定状态。 单击**“确定”**。一个新项目便创建完成，并在 Visual Studio 设计器窗口中打开 MainPage.xaml。 在 MainPage.xaml 中，将名为 ContentPanel 的 Grid 替换为以下代码。该代码将为我们的 UI 创建四个按钮。 123456&lt;Grid x:Name=\"ContentPanel\" Grid.Row=\"1\" Margin=\"12,0,12,0\"&gt; &lt;Button Content=\"Start One Time Schedule\" Height=\"72\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Center\"

创建磁贴计划 向 MainPage.xaml.cs 文件的顶部添加一个 using 指令并提供包含 ShellTileSchedule 的命名空间的名称。 1 Microsoft.Phone.Shell; 声明并初始化用于计划和状态的变量。 123 MainPage : PhoneApplicationPage&#123; ShellTileSchedule SampleTileSchedule

SampleTileSchedule.StartTime = DateTime.Now; SampleTileSchedule.RemoteImageUri = Uri(); SampleTileSchedule.Start(); TileScheduleRunning = ;&#125; 添加用于设置运行次数不确定的计划的代码。请记住，如果该计划失败次数太多，将取消该计划。 12345678 buttonIndefinite_Click( sender, RoutedEventArgs e)&#123; SampleTileSchedule.Recurrence = UpdateRecurrence.Interval; SampleTileSchedule.Interval = UpdateInterval.EveryHour; SampleTileSchedule.RemoteImageUri = Uri(); SampleTileSchedule.Start(); TileScheduleRunning = ;&#125; 添加用于设置某个计划的代码，该计划将更新磁贴无限次。同样，如果该计划失败次数太多，将取消该计划。 123456789 buttonDefined_Click( sender, RoutedEventArgs e)&#123; SampleTileSchedule.Recurrence = UpdateRecurrence.Interval; SampleTileSchedule.Interval = UpdateInterval.EveryHour; SampleTileSchedule.MaxUpdateCount = 50; SampleTileSchedule.RemoteImageUri = Uri(); SampleTileSchedule.Start(); TileScheduleRunning = ;&#125; 添加用于停止任何正在运行的计划的代码。请注意，我们如何通过首先启动计划来附加到该计划。 123456789 buttonStop_Click( sender, RoutedEventArgs e)&#123; (!TileScheduleRunning) &#123; buttonIndefinite_Click(sender, e); &#125; SampleTileSchedule.Stop(); TileScheduleRunning = ;&#125; 调试更新计划可能具有挑战性。为了省电，对更新进行批处理，因此可能需要多达约一小时的时间才能看到更新后的图像。当设备锁定时将不会进行更新，因为用户将看不到更新。 运行和调试应用程序的步骤 通过选择**“调试 | 启动调试”**菜单命令运行应用程序。 当模拟器初始化并且您的程序正在运行时，按模拟器上的**“开始”按键以进入“开始”屏幕。导航到应用程序列表并找到您的应用程序。长按应用程序名称，然后从上下文菜单中选择“固定到‘开始’屏幕”**。应用程序磁贴便固定到“开始”屏幕。 按**“返回”**按键返回您的应用程序。按应用程序上的其中一个按钮启动某个计划。 返回“开始”屏幕。等待该计划运行，以查看结果。请记住，此过程可能需要一小段时间，因为需要对更新进行批处理。 计划次要磁贴 尽管该示例没有次要磁贴，但您也可以通过向 ShellTileSchedule 构造函数传递磁贴信息来为次要磁贴设置计划。下面的示例演示了如何为每个现有磁贴设置计划。 12345678 (ShellTile TileToSchedule ShellTile.ActiveTiles)&#123; ShellTileSchedule mySchedule = ShellTileSchedule(TileToSchedule); mySchedule.Interval = UpdateInterval.EveryHour; mySchedule.Recurrence = UpdateRecurrence.Interval;

人生中，我們總是懷揣著理想，總是希望著能夠打出屬於自己的一片天地。有一些人，從小便懷揣著夢想，但是現實總是潑他們一盤冷水。他們不幹了。但是，夢想，不是遙不可及，是沒有付諸全力，全身心的投入其中，再大的困難，都阻擋不了。 有夢就有未來 一百多年前，一位窮苦的牧羊人帶著兩個幼小的兒子替別人放羊為生。有一天，他們趕著羊來到一個山坡上，一群大雁鳴叫著從他們頭頂飛過，並很快消失在遠方。牧羊人的小兒子問父親：“大雁要往哪裡飛？”牧羊人說：“它們要去一個溫暖的地方，在那裡安家，度過寒冷的冬天。”大兒子眨著眼睛羡慕地說：“要是我也能像大雁那樣飛起來就好了。”小兒子也說：“要是能做一隻會飛的大雁該多好啊！”牧羊人沉默了一會兒，然後對兩個兒子說：“只要你們想，你們也能飛起來。” 兩個兒子試了試，都沒能飛起來，他們用懷疑的眼神看著父親，牧羊人說：“讓我飛給你們看。”於是他張開雙臂，但也沒能飛起來。可是，牧羊人肯定地說：“我因為年紀大了才飛不起來，你們還小，只要不斷努力，將來就一定能飛起來，去想去的地方。” 牧羊人帶給兩個兒子一個夢想：我要飛。1903年，他們的“飛行者一號”成為了世界上第一架真正意義上的飛機。他們，就是萊特兄弟。是的，有夢就能成就未來。夢，也不是那麼遙不可及。 人生不設限 史蒂芬·威廉·霍金，物理學家、宇宙學家、數學家。他的眾多理論使人類的發展有了長足的進步。曾經，他與眾多人一樣，懷揣著夢想。但是，他在21歲時不幸患上了會使肌肉萎縮的盧伽雷氏症。這使他無法動彈。1985年，因患肺炎做了穿氣管手術，被徹底剝奪了說話的能力，演講和問答只能通過語音合成器來完成，這使情況雪上加霜。但是，面對如此困難，他沒有氣餒。當時醫生預測他最多活兩年，但他依然活著。他從未放棄自己的研究，相反的，他更加的努力。1973年，他考查黑洞附近的量子效應，發現黑洞會像天體一樣發出輻射，其輻射的溫度和黑洞品質成反比，這樣黑洞就會因為輻射而慢慢變小，而溫度卻越變越高，最後以爆炸而告終。黑洞輻射或霍金輻射的發現具有極其基本的意義，它將廣義相對論、量子場論和熱力學統一在一起。這就是霍金最著名的理論之一——霍金輻射。 他的夢想受到巨大的困難所牽絆，但他沒有放棄。他的堅持，使他的夢想終於結出果實。只要你能面對困難，人生，永遠不設限。夢，也不是那麼遙不可及。 路是走出來的 “這世上本沒有路。走的人多了，也變成了路。”魯迅曾經說過。魯迅是中國近代最著名的作家之一，他的作品尖銳深刻，直戳要害。他曾經去日本，懷著救人的夢想前往日本求學，然而，他發現中國人的病不在身體上，而在精神上。當時，沒人當作家，去“治療”人們精神上的病，而他是第一人。 他的敢作敢為，是我深深地瞭解到，實現夢想，有很多路，不必拘泥于一條路。你要走出一條屬於自己的路，這樣，夢想，才不會那麼遙不可及。 有夢，才有未來。但是夢，不是遙不可及。只有堅持自己的夢想，面對困難不妥協，只有這樣，我們才能開闢出一條路，創造出屬於自己的一片天！","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Essay","slug":"Essay","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Essay/"}]},{"title":"再黑暗，我們也有期望","slug":"hope-even-though-darker","date":"2013-05-20T09:46:00.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","comments":true,"path":"2013/05/20/hope-even-though-darker/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2013/05/20/hope-even-though-darker/","excerpt":"期望，是一個名詞。意思是指人們對每樣東西的提前勾畫出的一種標準，達到了這個標準就是達到了期望值。簡單地講，就是希望，等待。

，全新的明天仍然等待我來證明自己”。是的，每個人的心中，總是會有著期望，朝著各自的目標，不斷的努力。盡己所能，一步一步，構建出自己理想的未來。 但是，現在的世界，不再那麼充滿著期望。來自四面八方的“大地震”——不僅僅是指那些使人陰陽分隔、令人聞風喪膽的自然災害，還一併包括社會上、政治上、經濟上的“大地震”：貪污、腐敗困擾著不知多多少少個政府；社會上貧富差距的加大、競爭力的加劇使空氣中始終能夠感受到一股敵對的火藥味；而經濟的風暴還沒有退去。 有人說，這個社會，不再具有期望。眺望遠方，黑暗似乎已經襲來；抬起頭，其實才發現，黑暗就在這兒。 每一天，都有光明和黑暗，所以，其實，黑暗就在我們身邊，人生，總有不稱心時。這時，我們就需要期望，我們對期望的需求，是十分大的。 但是，我們有對自己的期望，別人，也可能對我們有期望。的確，在黑暗中，我們需要別人的期望做自己的導航燈，坐我們的潤滑油。然而，我們還是要看看，這潤滑油是不適合我們。 這裡，有一個很多人熟知的故事。有一位登山者準備攀珠穆朗瑪峰在攀越珠穆朗瑪峰前人們對他充滿期待，希望他能夠登上峰頂。當他在爬到距離峰頂前的600米處，他停下了而返回。人們覺得非常可惜，問他為什麼不堅持下去，就差那麼一點點了，他微笑地回答道：“這已是我登山紀錄裡最好最高的一次了。我並沒有覺得遺憾，反而感到很自豪，我已經滿足了。”所以，別人的期望，可以作為我們的目標，但我們要看一看，這一目標，是不適合我們能夠力所能及的。 現在，我們這些年輕富有青春活力的學生，仍在戰場上奮鬥著。我們需要有著對自己的期望，才能在學習的戰場上越戰越勇。歌德說過，“你若要喜愛你自己的價值，你就得給世界創造價值”。只要我們能夠努力學習，並能發展自己的一技之長，這樣，在未來，我們就能為社會奉獻出自己的一份力！ 再黑暗，我們也會有期望！","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Essay","slug":"Essay","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Essay/"}]},{"title":"我理想中的太平盛世","slug":"the-ideal-world","date":"2012-09-22T21:06:34.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","comments":true,"path":"2012/09/22/the-ideal-world/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2012/09/22/the-ideal-world/","excerpt":"在唐朝&quot;貞觀之治&quot;時期，“官吏多自清謹。制馭王公、妃主之家，大姓豪猾之伍，皆畏威屏跡，無敢侵欺細人。商旅野次，無複盜賊，囹圄常空，馬牛布野，外戶不閉。又頻致豐稔，米鬥三四錢”。唐太祖又&quot;去奢省費，輕瑤薄賦，選用廉史，使民衣食有餘，則自不為盜&quot;，還有魏徽、杜如晦和房玄齡的幫助，使唐朝達到歷史上的盛世，以致“此皆古昔未有也”。","text":"在唐朝&quot;貞觀之治&quot;時期，“官吏多自清謹。制馭王公、妃主之家，大姓豪猾之伍，皆畏威屏跡，無敢侵欺細人。商旅野次，無複盜賊，囹圄常空，馬牛布野，外戶不閉。又頻致豐稔，米鬥三四錢”。唐太祖又&quot;去奢省費，輕瑤薄賦，選用廉史，使民衣食有餘，則自不為盜&quot;，還有魏徽、杜如晦和房玄齡的幫助，使唐朝達到歷史上的盛世，以致“此皆古昔未有也”。 而現在，已經到了21世紀。現在的社會日新月異，但人民的生活水準似乎沒有趕上社會的發展，貧富差距日益擴大，犯罪率也不斷上升之時，我，幻想能有一個“太平盛世”。 但,這個理想的“太平盛世”並不是《禮記·禮運》中的“大同社會”，也不是陶淵明筆下的桃花源。我認為，理想之中的太平盛世，應是一個公平競爭合作的社會。人與人、團體與團體、政府與政府之間，既能進行公平競爭,又能進行相互合作,實現團體、社會的雙贏，從而使社會高速發展。並且，人人都能夠熱愛祖國，互相尊敬，尊重事實，尊崇真理，尊敬老人，愛護小孩，遵紀守法，誠信待人，對不同人、不同文化以包容理解的姿態去對待。 官員應為人正直，為民著想，真正做實事，做好事，認真聆聽百姓的聲音；人們也應能夠自由表達出他們最真實的心聲。我們來看看《禮記·禮運》的大道之行也的部分：“大道之行也，天下為公，選賢與能，講信修睦。故人不獨親其親，不獨子其子，使老有所終，壯有所用，幼有所長，矜、寡、孤、獨、廢疾者皆有所養，男有分，女有歸。貨惡其棄於地也，不必藏於己；力惡其不出於身也，不必為己。是故謀閉而不興，盜竊亂賊而不作，故外戶而不閉，是謂大同。”據這篇段落，我們可以確切的說：官員應是人民的公僕，是應該為人民服務的；另一方面，各行各業會更加認認真真做好自己的本職工作；每個家庭都會變得和和美美；人與人之間相互信任，互相關愛。 在生活方面,人人都遵守交通法規，尊崇社會公德；物品價格不再被一些不法人士抬高，人人都能達到小康的生活水準；住房不再是難題。而在商業體系上，再也不會存在那些爾虞我詐,會變的更加誠信、真實,給顧客真正的實惠；金融體系會更加穩固，不容易崩潰，市場經濟穩步的上升，國家社會體系更加穩定，人人都能可以公平公正的應試、應聘、競爭、投票，並不使用非法的手段來取得成功。 這，就是我所認為的大同社會。這就是，我理想中的太平盛世。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Essay","slug":"Essay","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Essay/"}]},{"title":"那棵樹","slug":"that-tree","date":"2012-09-15T08:00:42.000Z","updated":"2021-06-04T05:51:58.308Z","comments":true,"path":"2012/09/15/that-tree/","link":"","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/2012/09/15/that-tree/","excerpt":"放学路上的偶然一瞥，让我不觉驻足。

粗壮的枝干由密密的纹路诉说当年的沧桑，碧绿的叶片安静地向下垂，任随秋风随意摆弄，发出极其轻微的、不易察觉的沙沙声。那些老去的黄叶被秋风温柔的吹落，在空中飘飞。它们面对着阳光，面对它们人生中的最后一次洗礼。在夕阳的照耀下，无论是新叶还是老叶，都闪耀着绚烂的光芒。我知道，那是生命的光芒。 顺着它的枝干向他的跟望去，才发现，根部，是从两块大石头之间生长出来的。粗壮的根部向几块大石头蔓延开来。根那么粗，有一根人的手臂那么粗，一直延伸到行步道上。一直，不断，直到行步道的对面。 很难相信一棵树能在如此艰难的条件下存活。这真的很难。想象一下，从生物角度来说，，一粒种子，它需要阳光、空气和水，才具有生存的条件。没有阳光，就如出生的婴儿没有呼吸，叶绿体无法生存，营养物质缺失，导管与帅管退化，在那时候他唯一的选择，就是死。 但他没有选择死。在与死神的战斗中，在命运的挣扎中，他挺了起来。他站了起来，没有向命运所屈服。他拼命地生根，拼命地寻找阳光。终于，它钻出来了。它打破了命运的符咒，迎着太阳，茁壮的成长。 望着他粗壮的根须，心中想象着他成长的历程，不禁感慨着。自然是伟大的。它能够缔造如此伟大、如此神奇的树，而人不能。人只能模仿自然，不能创造自然。而那棵树，则是大自然对人类的恩惠。 夕阳西下，那棵树人坚强的立在那里。祝福你，祝你能够继续坚强地活下去。","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Essay","slug":"Essay","permalink":"https://patrickwu.space/tags/Essay/"}]},{"title":"資源調查報告

最後結果是：飲用水的PH值：六；雨水的PH值：六；自來水的PH值：八；附近河水的PH值：六。到此為止，看的出來，飲用水、雨水、附近的河水都呈酸性，只有自來水呈鹼性。這是怎麼回事？看來，我們對好好保護水資源。 這是本人小學五年級時寫的文章，來自於舊博客。所有真名已匿名化。
