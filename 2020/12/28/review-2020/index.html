			<p>Well, you know what time it is. It’s my annual review time. And from now on, the review will be in English.</p>
<p>With the pandemic going on and the continuing political suppression in Hong Kong, it is getting very emotional for me this year.</p>
<p>Let’s review my 2020, starting from my last year’s goal:</p>
<h2 id="2020-did-i-do-it"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#2020-did-i-do-it"></a> 2020, Did I do it?</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://patrickwu.space/2019/12/25/review-2019/">Last Year’s Annual Review</a>, I made the following goal for the year:</p>
<ul>
<li>開始做音樂 (Start Making Music)</li>
<li>寫《和平路書報攤》和《WSL指北》(Write a novel planned and <em>Ultimate Guide to WSL</em>)</li>
<li>認真的去找個女朋友(Get a girlfriend, seriously)</li>
<li>繼續鍛鍊(Keep Exercising)</li>
<li>找到工作/考研成功 (Find a job or pursue a master degree successfully)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="starting-making-music"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#starting-making-music"></a> Starting Making Music</h3>
<p>I did start to compose some small pieces of music… Although nothing is published, progress is progress.</p>
<h3 id="write-a-novel-planned-and-ultimate-guide-to-wsl"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#write-a-novel-planned-and-ultimate-guide-to-wsl"></a> Write a novel planned and <em>Ultimate Guide to WSL</em></h3>
<p>Almost forget I have these goals… Should pick them up next year</p>
<h3 id="get-a-girlfriend-seriously"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#get-a-girlfriend-seriously"></a> Get a girlfriend, seriously</h3>
<p>Initially want to make a pandemic excuse, but well, it’s still my own fault for not socializing ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p>This is going to stay on the annual goal list forever…</p>
<h3 id="keep-exercising"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#keep-exercising"></a> Keep Exercising</h3>
<p>I did! With getting Nintendo Switch, I no longer just jogging… I also do different exercises in RingFit Adventure and Rope Skipping in Rope Jump Challenge, which made me regret why I didn’t get it early this year.</p>
<h3 id="find-a-job-or-pursue-a-master-degree-successfully"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#find-a-job-or-pursue-a-master-degree-successfully"></a> Find a job or pursue a master degree successfully</h3>
<p>I actually never thought this would not only be achieved but also the “or” should be changed to “and.” Not only I got a dream job at Canonical, but even I earned a master’s degree offer from CUHK with a scholarship.</p>
<h2 id="2020-what-did-i-do"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#2020-what-did-i-do"></a> 2020, what did I do?</h2>
<p>This year, despite the awful toxic environment around the world, I did more things I thought I would do this year, mostly due to lock-downs.</p>
<p>I gave <a href="">a talk</a> in WSLConf 2020, and with the help of it, I was able to get a Software Developer job at Canonical focusing on developing Ubuntu for WSL and Hyper-V. I thought this is the end of the surprise, but no, I got a master’s offer with a scholarship! I never thought I would achieve that much this year, but here we are.</p>
<p>This year, I started to study Esperanto(Estas mia plej flua lingvo, unu afiŝo elvenos baldaŭ), Japanese(流暢に話せません), and French(Je est débutant).</p>
<p>This year, I got Netflix and started to watch there, which allowed me to watch more movies and shows than before.</p>
<p>This year, I did not do much of the reading, mostly due to the work and study. I do pick up the Fazbear’s Frights series, but that is mostly all. Next year, I think I can get more chances to read after my master study complete.</p>
<h2 id="2020-what-did-i-make"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#2020-what-did-i-make"></a> 2020, what did I make?</h2>
<p>I made a lot of things this year. Within this year, I made Ubuntu WSL Onboarding Experience that consists of the main OOBE Experience (<code>ubuntu-wsl-oobe</code>), the <code>ubuntuwsl</code> utility (<code>ubuntu-wsl-integration</code>), and CI/CD system for Ubuntu (<code>ubuntu-cooker</code>). Also, during this period, I successfully completed another project, <code>PsUWI</code>.</p>
<p>My old project, <code>wslu</code> now reaches version 3.2.1, and 4.0.0 is still being worked on.</p>
<p>Due to the pandemic, I cannot do much of the photography this year, but I did take some of the photos that receive some good response like <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/v8dj-2mURXo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a> with over 100k views.</p>
<h2 id="2021-whats-next"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#2021-whats-next"></a> 2021, what’s next?</h2>
<h3 id="write-a-novel-planned-and-ultimate-guide-to-wsl-2"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#write-a-novel-planned-and-ultimate-guide-to-wsl-2"></a> Write a novel planned and <em>Ultimate Guide to WSL</em></h3>
<p>I have a terrible habit of not able to concentrate on writing… This year, I will start trying my best to spare time to write them.</p>
<h3 id="get-a-girlfriend"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#get-a-girlfriend"></a> Get a girlfriend</h3>
<p>Well, <strong>THE</strong> annual list member that won’t be crossed out any time soon ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<h3 id="get-fit"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#get-fit"></a> Get Fit</h3>
<p>As I continue to exercise, I should start moving to the next stage: Not just exercise, I should begin to lose weight and get fit.</p>
