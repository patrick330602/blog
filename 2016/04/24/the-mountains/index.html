			<p>There is nothing more precious than new experiences. This 3-day camping experience have really blown my mind and change how I really see act as an individual and as a team. With the failures and success, pains and happiness within, I harvest this best experience ever.</p>
<p>Imagining walking alone, in a dark deep forest, slowly. It is already frightening when you hear it. That was the first night, and we were asked to walk alone in the dark deep forest, to give space to us to think about our future. We are asked to walk one by one with the gap of 3 minutes, to make sure that we are all walking solely. All of us had to wait patiently until it’s our turn. Soon, I could not wait and cut in the line to go first. At first, everything was fine for me. I felt quite comfortable at first, while the wind was blowing smoothly. I felt comfortable and walked in a normal speed, to think about my future. When I just decided that I will complete all of the apps that I have delayed in this academic year, I suddenly got a feeling of scare. I don’t know where it comes from, I was just simply scared. I left my torch on and started to run in this dark forest. I made it eventually. But this one really teach me that actually, the scare can cause hallucination. Sometimes, in our life, there are always challenges like these hallucinations that can scares you, but if we don’t be afraid of it, we can eventually achieve what we really want.</p>

<p>And you know, sometimes the worst nightmare isn’t at night, and your best experience isn’t at day. In the night of the second day, we were impatiently waiting for hiking. No need to prepare for dinner? Perfect. I picked up the schedule reading, thinking. But this perfect dream soon broke by the operator’s announcement: “Now, you will approach to hike. But, you need to hike to fight for your dinner. Good luck!” what a shock. We need to hike to fight for the food? “We need strategies in order to hike perfectly.” Someone in our team said. We immediately agreed with his idea with no doubt. However, we soon had disagreements about the routine. Our ideas are too diverged that we are the last one to go. Everything went fine at first. We got our food directly and fast, which gave us a lot of confidence. But soon we had a trust problem with each other. We couldn’t find the position of the check point, so we stopped a few times checking whether the position is right or not. Although we did check, we still missed the check point. What’s even worse, we walked two extra kilometers- which means we wasted a lot of time on seeking the check point. We finally give up looking for more food and went back, although it was already very dark. Surprisingly, we actually found our dinner very delicious. I felt strange, since I didn’t think this make any sense. But then I realized that because we still get something more than a dinner. When we wondering whether it is right or not, we should be brave enough to rise objection instead of muting yourself and following what others doing.</p>
<p>This camp let me learn so much about myself as well as how to behave in a team.</p>
<p>As we walked through the mountains, I feel really lucky to join this camp. This camp really opens my eyes. These mountains, with all the great memories, will all be rooted deeply into my mind. Hope one day, I can climb up the peak of the my mountains-life.</p>
