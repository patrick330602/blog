title: Usage Of the new Segoe MDL2 icons
---
The Windows 8/8.1 **Segoe UI Symbol** icon font has been replaced with the **Segoe MDL2 Assets** font effective with the release of Windows 10. It can be used in much the same manner as the older font, but many glyphs have been redrawn in the Windows 10 icon style with the font’s metrics set so that icons are aligned within the font’s em-square instead of on a typographic baseline.So in Windows 10, You have to use the new Segoe MDL2. Besides the traditional use, There is other more simple way of using them. Font direct is a way I find that can be useful. I found this way by using the IntensiveTemplate to build my app uwp.HKUST. They use the direct font:

![code]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/image-2.png) 

Then it will be very hard to input the font. I have tried to find a good website to find the way to input the font since the system itself don’t support the extended Segoe UI Symbol series. I find a great website to transfer the code: [Unicode Converter](https://www.branah.com/unicode-converter) . This is a great website to type the untypeable code.

Now, WeCode is the app developed by me that simplified everything for you.[Download](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh5p90f) here now!
